1. ran `sudo gem install github-to-canvas` from the canvas-pilot directory (no gemfile appears, what does this mean?)

2. made an access token via canvas admin area

3. ran `echo "$(export 'CANVAS_API_KEY=7~v5o2bj4ZiEPbJrK2CiC20bQHlHNGJndt142v8nbPRkGUWiZ3wTanneCQMAZcL6xq' | cat - ~/.zshrc)" > ~/.zshrc` (instructions from github-to-canvas readme )
4. ran `echo "$(export 'CANVAS_API_PATH=https://canvas.instructure.com/api/v1' | cat  - ~/.zshrc)" > ~/.zshrc` (instructions from github-to-canvas readme) this part wasn't clear - it seems like using your own installation is implied and then you use the URL to your own installation's API
<!-- ! are we considering cloud? or install on LHL servers? -->
