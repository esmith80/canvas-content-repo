1. ran `sudo gem install github-to-canvas` from the canvas-pilot directory (no gemfile appears, what does this mean? where is this code?)

2. made an access token via canvas admin area

3. made ENV variables (export `CANVAS_API_KEY` and export `CANVAS_API_PATH` - unsure if the path is correct?)

3. ran `echo "$(export 'CANVAS_API_KEY=7~v5o2bj4ZiEPbJrK2CiC20bQHlHNGJndt142v8nbPRkGUWiZ3wTanneCQMAZcL6xq' | cat - ~/.zshrc)" > ~/.zshrc` (instructions from github-to-canvas readme )
4. ran `echo "$(export 'CANVAS_API_PATH=https://canvas.instructure.com/api/v1' | cat  - ~/.zshrc)" > ~/.zshrc` (instructions from github-to-canvas readme) this part wasn't clear - it seems like using your own installation is implied and then you use the URL to your own installation's API
<!-- ! are we considering cloud? or install on LHL servers? -->

5. read that for Canvas installation to work install Ruby 2.7.0 or greater (but not as high as 2.3.0); thought this was some reason 
- used command `rbenv install 2.7.0` failed
- used command `rbenv install 2.7.2` and it worked
  - added `.ruby-version` file to local project and it changed the version successfully

6. ran `github-to-canvas --read-from-github https://github.com/esmith80/canvas-pilot` and that worked but it expects a README.md file only? on a `master` branch?

7. read that code fenced blocks can be customized with custom css (there are built-in classes called `ruby-highlighting` and `javascript-highlighting` I noticed)
see here: http://jwarby.github.io/jekyll-pygments-themes/languages/javascript.html

8. installed canvas locally (used Docker - was easy with Docker, after failing to install manually (had an error about thrift 0.9.3 that was expected as per Canvas Quick setup docs, but the recommended fix didn't work)

9. ran `gem install github-to-canvas` in the newly installed Canvas
