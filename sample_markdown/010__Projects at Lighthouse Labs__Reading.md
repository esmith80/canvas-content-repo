Every module of learning has an evaluated project.  Designed as project-based learning, the projects are contextual, active, and social learning experiences:
 
1. **Contextual Learning**: The learning is designed to be relevant to and mimic an on-the-job task, as a means of readying learners to meet the demands and requirements of the job and role.

2. **Active Learning**: As learners progress through the project, they will be teaching themselves and learning required knowledge and skills through defined learning activities that pull through and apply previous knowledge, with lectures from instructors to support the learning journey.

3. **Social Learning**: Active learning is supported through interactions, assistances, and program opportunities that connect learners with their instructors, mentors, and peers to share knowledge and understanding.

Project evaluation is defined in the projectâ€™s rubric, which is designed using the Web Developer Competency Framework. Each project (with the exception of the Final Project) is also supported by a functional requirements list. Similar to a standard set of project criteria, the functional requirements identify what is needed for the project to be successful and meet outcomes. The requirements and the explanation of the requirements will differ from project to project, similar to the variation in requirements learners will eventually engage with on the job.  No manager, client, or project is the same, and part of the learning is navigating and executing the unique tasks and requirements.
