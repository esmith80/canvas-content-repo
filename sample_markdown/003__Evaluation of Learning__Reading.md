Evaluation is often associated with the determination of value against a set of standards or criteria.  Whether grades, score, or pass/fail, evaluation in learning has typically marked the endpoint or value of a learning journey.  At Lighthouse Labs, our evaluation model is designed to support the learning journey and the pathway to becoming job-ready. 

Lighthouse Labs uses role specific work outcomes to design assessments that mimic authentic on-the-job tasks, and evaluates these assessments using a Web Developer Skills Framework that is developed to align with industry standards and role requirements.  

At any given point in their learning journey at Lighthouse Labs, Learners can use evaluation to identify their individual strengths as well as areas for growth as it pertains to becoming job-ready.

**Web Developer Skills Framework**

The Web Developer Skills Framework defines the required skills of a web developer in role and breaks down levels of job performance for each skill. This breakdown allows learners to identify their current level of performance for a specific skill set as it relates to their evaluation of an assessment.

Learners are encouraged to reference the Web Developer Skills Framework and reflect on their performance throughout their learning journey to identify the next steps and goals.
