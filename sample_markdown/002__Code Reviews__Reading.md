## Code Reviews

At Lighthouse Labs, Code Reviews are an important part of the learning journey. Code Reviews are an opportunity for learners to walk through their code, validate their coding comprehension, and get feedback for improvement.

Learners can have both unevaluated and evaluated Code Reviews. Unevaluated Code Reviews provide learners with the practice and confidence to discuss their code in the evaluated Code Reviews, and will only be done by request as they are not required. 

Ultimately, Lighthouse Labsâ€™ goal with Code Reviews is to get learners comfortable talking about their code, getting feedback and learning about coding best practices from someone in the industry, and ensuring learners are progressing in their coding skills.


**Unevaluated Code Reviews:**

* Can be done by request 
* Are done individually with the mentor
* Learners select the learning activity for the Code Review
* Learners are responsible for requesting their Code Reviews through Rudder


**Evaluated Code Reviews:**

* There will be 4 total (M1, M3, M4, M9)
* Lighthouse Labs preselects the learning activity for the Code Reviews
* Will be done asynchronously (there will be an assigned mentor that will evaluate and provide feedback)
* Are evaluated by the mentor using the coding comprehension skill, as defined in the Web Developer Skills Framework
* Learners receive feedback from the mentor after the Code Review and receive their evaluation as a score in their dashboard after the Code Review
