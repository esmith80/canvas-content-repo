If you're feeling a bit overwhelmed from the number of activities and your progress, not to worry,  you will very likely find that most of your fellow Labbers are feeling the same way.

This note is just a friendly reminder to not freak out due to the workload. The rest of this course will also have you feeling this way.

Your education managers keep a close eye on your progress and can help advise the best course of action if you find yourself struggling to keep up. It can be different depending on the content that you are behind on, so don't be afraid to ask them.

On the flip side, if you are ahead of schedule and finishing early, we recommend taking the extra time to work on the stretch work (when provided).

Speaking of progress, we do require you to accurately mark what you've completed, how long it took and submit any accompanying code as a GitHub URL so that both we and you can track your progress.
