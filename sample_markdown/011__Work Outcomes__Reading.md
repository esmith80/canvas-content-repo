The program is a journey and one that prepares learners to be job-ready, and achieve the ultimate career outcome of gaining employment as a web developer. Being job-ready doesnâ€™t mean knowing everything, but rather having the foundation and the skills to be able to meet work challenges and problem solve for them.  

After completing the Web Flex Developer Program, learners will be able to:

* Troubleshoot and debug problems associated with web development.
* Demonstrate problem-solving skills by developing basic algorithms to solve coding challenges or katas.
* Evaluate or analyze coding solutions/ideas, and their limitations and/or benefits.
* Discuss components that make up a web application at the "application layer".
* Contribute to full-stack web applications using modern software development patterns, tools and workflows:
    * Contribute to the backend of web applications that use industry-standard languages (Ruby) and frameworks (Rails and Express).
    * Contribute to existing frontend implementations that are using modern SPA patterns (React).
    * Integrate into common development team workflows (git, github workflow, automated testing, and code reviews).
    * Extend existing database design, as well as writing realistic SQL queries to CRUD data in SQL databases.
    * Create API services and/or consumers that use modern data formats such as JSON.
* Describe the importance and practical applications of Computer Science concepts that apply to web development (Trees, Recursion, Big-O).
* Work collaboratively within a development team to plan and produce a web application that meets a specific set of objectives.
* Employ specific learning strategies and frameworks to continue to build their skill set while on the job.
* Identify knowledge gaps, growth path, and specialization pathways, and develop actionable next steps for themselves immediately after completing the program.
