Web Flex is the type of program where what you put in is what you get out. Therefore, putting in the hours is how you will be successful in this program. If you're completing all the core work early, there is stretch work to move on to. You may also choose to continue and get ahead in the core learning.

If completing the core work takes up the bulk of your allotted time for the week, that's totally okay and expected! Stretch work is in place to have more to do if you're done early and want a challenge but is not required if you've got your hands full with the core work. Focus on your progress and pushing yourself to your limits.
