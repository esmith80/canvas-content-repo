Learning doesn’t end with the submission of an assignment, the completion of a module, or successfully making it through one of our programs. Learning is a journey and Lighthouse Labs encourages all learners to continue on, whether still in a program, job seeking, or in role.  

Lighthouse Labs has two stretch projects that can be completed at any time, Battle Ship and Open Source. It is recommended that Battle Ship is the first project, and Open Source is the second project. If learners don’t have the opportunity to complete these projects during their program, learners can complete them to further develop their portfolios after graduating.  

Program Stretch Work can also be completed after graduating, as continued upskilling.
