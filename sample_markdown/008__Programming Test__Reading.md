You will periodically have tests - which aren’t so much a tests, more like a set of coding challenges. You can expect the test set up to take around 20-30 minutes with the instructor over zoom.

Try not to stress! We know that the word “test” can be anxiety inducing, but this “test” isn’t like tests you’re used to—it’s not to decide anything about passing or failing, it’s just to get a sense of how you’re doing. Tests are not a make or break thing. See where you can get with it in two hours, but know that the tests are iterative so you can come back to the answers and rework them until you’ve got your score up.
The tests are NOT:

*  A Collaborative exercise. You are expected to solve it on your own, without help from your peers and mentors. Mentors can help you with the concepts but should not be working through the questions with you.
* Exceptionally difficult and designed to fail people and stress you out for no good reason
The only thing we really look at when assessing your progress.
* An accurate prediction of how good you are going to be in the coming months.

But, the tests ARE:

* One of many ways that you are evaluated and can use as a method of self evaluation.
* A good milestone to assess how well you can debug code under some level of stress.
* A good exercise to practice for technical, in-person or take home interviews that you will likely encounter when applying for any dev roles in the near future.
