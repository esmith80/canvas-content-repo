At the outset of all projects, we recommended that learners:

* Read the project description to determine the learning context and task.
* Read the project outcomes to identify the project objectives.
* Read the projectâ€™s functional requirements to identify the specific criteria from each learning activity.
* Read the rubric to identify the competencies being evaluated, beyond the project-specific criteria.
* Work incrementally, taking small steps and experimenting with their code to better understand how things work. 
    * This is general best practice. Go beyond the instructions and work incrementally by taking smaller steps and even side steps to better understand a concept.
* Deal with multiple functions and files:
    * Add detailed comments within their code, describing functions and modules concisely.
    * Constantly keep the maintainability of the project in mind. No extreme is good. Writing everything in one function or one giant file is typically bad. So is breaking out the code into too many separate files.
    * Strive for a healthy balance of modular code, but that does not mean that it is an overall ideal solution. There is always room for improvement.
    * Keep code clean by refactoring as they progress instead of deferring major refactoring work to the end. This is generally good practice, and again, like with any craft, there is a balancing act here.
* Zoom in and zoom out regularly:
    * Revisit the project objectives to ensure that the bigger picture and overall learning are on track.
    * Review the functional requirements of the learning activity.
