Please take a few minutes to read this important document outlining some ground rules for students and staff on how to operate while at Lighthouse Labs.

**Lighthouse Labs Code of Conduct**

Lighthouse Labs is a private education and training institution intended for enriching the developer community and building the next generation of developers. We value the participation of each member of each cohort and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the cohort and at all cohort events, whether officially sponsored by Lighthouse Labs or not.

To make clear what is expected, all students, teachers, mentors, speakers, staff, organizers, and volunteers at any Lighthouse Labs event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers and staff will enforce this code throughout the cohort.
Lighthouse Labs is dedicated to providing a harassment-free education experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not acceptable in any Lighthouse Labs venue, including talks.

Guest speakers, meetups, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, guest speakers should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
Be careful in the words that you choose. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing is not appropriate for Lighthouse Labs.
If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the staff may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the cohort or venue without refund or recompense.
Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the cohort without a refund at the sole discretion of the staff.
Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly educational experience for all.
