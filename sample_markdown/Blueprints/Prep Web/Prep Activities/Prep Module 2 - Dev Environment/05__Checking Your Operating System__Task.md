Before we get started, we need to make sure you are using the correct operating system.

While we strongly recommend using an Apple Macbook for your laptop, we also understand that it's not exactly the most economical option. If you already own a Windows laptop (which meets our <a href="https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/faq#details" target="_blank">minimum specs</a>) then you are expected to install and use Linux either alongside (dual boot) or instead of Windows. <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/developers" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> is our suggested vendor, but Mint is also a fair option.

There are many guides / tutorials that help you install Ubuntu and many of them are specific to your version of Windows. Please google and find a recent and appropriate one which addresses your specific needs.

Another alternative is to simply purchase an Ubuntu-based laptop, which Dell and other manufacturers do sell.

Again, before moving on with the rest of the prep modules, please make sure you are using the correct operating system for this course.
