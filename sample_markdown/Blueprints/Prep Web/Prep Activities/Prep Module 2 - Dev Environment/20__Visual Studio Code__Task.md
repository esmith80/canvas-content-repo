In order to write code, one needs a code editor.

Code editors are specialized text editors specifically for editing code files. In this activity we'll install, configure and explore Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a popular code editor.

## Downloading VS Code

The [Getting started with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) video on [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) demonstrates how to install VS Code.

> #### Instruction
> Watch the The [Getting started with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) video and follow the instructions to install VS Code to your computer.

## VSCode Layout

At its heart, VS Code is a code editor. Like many other code editors, VS Code adopts a common user interface and layout of an explorer on the left, showing all of the files and folders you have access to, and an editor on the right, showing the content of the files you have opened.

VS Code comes with a simple and intuitive layout that maximizes the space provided for the editor while leaving ample room to browse and access the full context of your folder or project. The UI is divided into five areas:

* **Editor** - The main area to edit your files. You can open as many editors as you like side by side vertically and horizontally.
* **Side Bar** - Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project.
* **Status Bar** - Information about the opened project and the files you edit.
* **Activity Bar** -  Located on the far left-hand side, this lets you switch between views and gives you additional context-specific indicators, like the number of outgoing changes when Git is enabled.
* **Panels** - You can display different panels below the editor region for output or debug information, errors and warnings, or an integrated terminal. Panel can also be moved to the right for more vertical space.

Each time you start VS Code, it opens up in the same state it was in when you last closed it. The folder, layout, and opened files are preserved.

## FAQs

**Q: Do I have to use VS Code? I'm already used to XYZ.**

You don't _have_ to use Visual Studio Code. If you're itching to learn something cooler but more difficult like VIM, we would suggest holding off. If you've heard about GitHub's Atom Editor and want to give that a shot instead, that's fair, but it's not really going to make things easier or more fun, in our opinion.

**Q: Am I expected to master VS Code? Should I learn keyboard shortcuts, etc?**

Being a power user of your code editor will make you a faster and more efficient developer, so over time you'll benefit greatly from mastering it. However, there are many other important things to focus on for now and trying to _master_ your editor at this point is too early, and will only serve as a distraction.

Your comfort level will come over time, with practice. In fact, the next activity will start you down that path!

## Conclusion

We have now installed the code editor that we will be using for the entire Bootcamp. In the next exercises, we will get more comfortable using VS Code by practicing some common tasks.
