Before jumping in, it's important that you understand the goals of this prep course and how they will be achieved.

## Audience

While anyone can sign up for an account and take advantage of it, this prep course is specifically designed and curated with our students in mind.

Our students must complete the work in this prep course as a prerequisite to the program as well as demonstrate an acceptable level of understanding of the material covered.

## Code Challenges & Quizzes

Among the prep course's readings, tasks and exercises you'll also find code-writing challenges and quizzes. These activities will provide you with the feedback you need to master the concepts and to sharpen your skills.

You will submit code challenges directly in Compass, which will automatically check your work and give you immediate feedback to use as you fix and improve the code, until both you and us are happy with it.

The quizzes will ask you several multiple-choice questions, and once you submit your answers, you'll see your results along with explanations for why each answer option is correct â€“ or not. We strongly recommend you review the explanations even if you got a perfect score as they are a great opportunity to reinforce what you've learned or to correct any misconceptions you may have!

## Your New Best Friend: Google

Don't be afraid to Google things often! When you are googling something related to programming, make sure you give your search some context. For example if you are trying to solve a problem in JavaScript, ensure that your search includes 'js'.

As you search you may notice that W3Schools will frequently be the top search result. While it's a good resource for beginners, we also highly recommend looking a little further down and checking out the results from [MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). 

MDN's documentation is updated constantly, but can be very technical. W3Schools can be less intimidating, but not as well detailed nor as well maintained as MDN. It will be good for you to try using both resources.

## Video Tutorials

If you find you would like another explanation of a topic, consider looking up an instructional video. A couple of excellent YouTubers with videos aimed at beginners are [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) and [Fun Fun Function](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q).
