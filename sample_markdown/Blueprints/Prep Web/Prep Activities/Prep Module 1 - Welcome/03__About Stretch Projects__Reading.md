This reading introduces you to the concept of _Stretch Projects_ in order to provide context and hopefully get you even more excited to prepare for your program.

## Reading

### Introduction

Unlike traditional education, all students that attend Lighthouse Labs have very different educational and professional backgrounds. Some have a background or even work experience with software, while others are learning to code for the first time. Despite being a very intense, fast-paced learning environment, we employ various techniques to cater to these diverse levels and backgrounds.

Stretch readings and challenges are scattered throughout the bootcamp and are also present in the prep work. Taking things even further are _Stretch Projects_.

_Stretch Projects_ expect you to solve a larger problem without directly teaching you all of the necessary skills or tools. By focusing on topics and techniques which you may not be familiar with, stretch projects require you to do more independent research, learning and problem solving. This type of challenge is a _big_ part of what it means to be a developer. It will be up to you to research new topics, distill your research into a workable theory and then finally apply that theory in order to solve the problem.

Lastly, all of our stretch projects are optional and as such, are not requirements for successfully completing the program. If you feel like you would benefit from these projects but are unable to find the time to work on them during the program, they will still be available for you to work on after you graduate. You can even come back to the stretch projects while you are job seeking, as a way of continuing to develop your skills whilst adding to your portfolio!

### Audience

Stretch projects therefore have multiple audiences:

- Students working through prep or bootcamp material who are further along in their programming abilities than the curriculum and want extra challenges in order to practice working with web technologies in a more self-guided manner
- Alumni that graduate the program and have both spare time and the confidence to tackle these more advanced projects

### Sneak Peek

The first stretch project is introduced in the prep course. It is placed near the end of the prep work so as to not distract you from the main learning outcomes. Don't worry if you do not get a chance to tackle this project before day one as it will make for a good stretch project during or even after the bootcamp itself.

If you're curious, feel free to spend a few minutes reading about the challenge in the [Bar Chart Project Introduction Reading](/1454bab4-06ab-434d-8d33-ccfb0d934dce).
