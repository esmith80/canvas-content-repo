Second, check out the reading below to prepare and inspire you!

## So you want to learn at Lighthouse Labs?

You're driven, you're passionate, you're eager to get your hands on a keyboard and start crafting the next web app that will take the world by storm. You teach yourself things for fun, your friends tell you that you should really do something  in technology. You face problems and view them as challenges, not obstacles. You thrive under pressure, basking in the opportunity to prove that you're capable. You learn by doing, aren't afraid to ask for help, and get lost in tasks that are creative and productive. You want to be a developer, and you believe Lighthouse Labs is the place to make that goal a reality.

You've chosen to learn with Lighthouse Labs, which means that you're going to participate in an educational model that is built very differently from the ones you may have experienced in high school and/or university. Lighthouse Labs practices a flipped, immersive model of education that puts the emphasis on the development of practical skills through building real-world applications, using an incremental and cumulative collection of tools and best practices.

You can expect to introduce yourself to new concepts through readings and exercises, getting your knowledge bolstered and backfilled with lectures throughout the week. These lectures will be delivered by developers who are actively working in the industry, who have a passion for taking the knowledge, skills, and experience that they have gathered in their development careers and breaking it down into understandable blocks of information. Your lab time will be supported by a talented group of mentors which Lighthouse has taken the time to bring in to assist you. All will be active developers in your community, able to offer their insights into the best way to approach each and every challenge you may be facing.

For the duration of the program, you will immerse yourself in the learning whilst building projects to add to your portfolio, readying you for job seeking. You will build applications you can show off and be proud of, using up-to-date technologies and techniques. You'll be able to demonstrate how spiffy you can make something look and how well you can make it work. And most importantly, you'll be able to lift the proverbial hood and prove an encyclopedic knowledge of the inner workings. 

We have a philosophy of education here at Lighthouse Labs. We believe that you need to know the mechanics of the major libraries and frameworks, and understand their inner workings, before you start applying them and using them to build applications. We'll always show you the hard way to do something first, and then give you an easier way, so that you appreciate why the easier way is actually easier and better for your app. You can say that we'll teach you why wheels are round and what tires do before giving you Formula 1 hubs with racing slicks.

Using the popular languages of JavaScript and Ruby, we're going to take you all the way from the basic programming fundamentals that are part of all software development up to the point that you have the skills and knowledge you need to build real-time big data applications that can be deployed on multiple platforms. Along the way, you'll learn important concepts that include debugging, refactoring, and optimization. We will make sure you are ready to enter the work force with the confidence that you can contribute from the first day of a job.

You may have heard of the Stone Soup story, where a family in a village is boiling water and rocks to feed themselves. Each family in the village begins to bring ingredients, contributing what they can until the community is able to produce a rich, luxurious pot of soup that all can share. Lighthouse Labs believes in this philosophy. Each student, each mentor, each staff member and each instructor are going to contribute something to your education. And each of our graduates will go forth into the developer community and add a new ingredient, something that improves and enriches.

Welcome to Lighthouse Labs! We can't wait to see what you're going to build, and we look forward to working with you on your path to becoming a part of the next generation of developers changing the world, one keystroke at a time.
