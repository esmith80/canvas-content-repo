Until now we've been working with simple types of values, known as primitive types in JavaScript. Strings, numbers, and booleans are all primitive types, and we use primitives to represent all of the data in our applications. For example, we could represent the names of cars using Strings.

```js
const car1 = "Volvo"
const car2 = "BMW" 
const car3 = "Ford";
```

But as our applications grow in size, we'll need a better plan for organizing all of these primitive values together. We will need a data structure.

```js
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW" , "Ford"];
```

In this exercise, we will learn about one of the most fundamental data structures, arrays.
