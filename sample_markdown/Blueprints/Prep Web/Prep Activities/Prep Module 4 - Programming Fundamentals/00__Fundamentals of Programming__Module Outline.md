In this module we're going to learn the fundamental concepts of programming in JavaScript by following along with practice exercises and solving coding challenges from scratch.

This section will be a mixture of activities that exist here, in Compass, and activities from Udacity.com. This means that we will need an account with Udacity, we will set this up in the next exercise, and that we will be switching back and forth between Udacity and Compass.

Grab your pen and notebook if you like to keep notes and your caffeinated beverage if you're into that sorta thing, 'cause we're ready to start coding seriously!
