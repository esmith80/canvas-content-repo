We've already seen how powerful arrays are at organizing our data, but sometimes it doesn't make sense to structure our data using an array. If we wanted to organize the characteristics of a coffee cup, the order of the array wouldn't make sense.

```js
const cup = ['white', '12oz', 'ceramic'];
```

Why is the color first? How do I determine the amount of coffee I can put in it? Instead of storing this data in an array, it would be much better to store it in a plain old Object. 

```js
const cup = {
  colour: 'white', 
  size: '12oz', 
  material: 'ceramic'
};
```

In this exercise, we will learn about how to use Objects in JavaScript.
