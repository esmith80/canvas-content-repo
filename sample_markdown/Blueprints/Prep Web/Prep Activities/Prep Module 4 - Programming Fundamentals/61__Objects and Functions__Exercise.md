We've touched on objects and functions a bit, but given their prominence and importance, it's time to practice these even more.

## NodeSchool

Let's continue with three more exercises in [NodeSchool's javascripting](https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting). 

> #### Instruction
> Continue with _OBJECTS_, _OBJECT PROPERTIES_, and _FUNCTIONS_.

In a [previous exercise in Module 2](/108d698f-0761-4cdb-9d74-243d72d2025a), we worked through part of NodeSchool's javascripting tutorial. In your Vagrant VM, `cd` back into your previously created `javascripting` directory where you created files for each of the exercises in the JavaScripting interactive workshop.

Previously, you (should have) stopped at the _LOOPING THROUGH ARRAYS_ exercise. Continue with _OBJECTS_, _OBJECT PROPERTIES_, and _FUNCTIONS_.

> #### Instruction
> Submit your code.

Add and commit your changes to the `git` repository, and then to push your new commits to GitHub.
