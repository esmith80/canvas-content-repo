We've made it pretty far into the Lighthouse Labs prep course. Let's celebrate by making some banana bread. Before we start baking, we'll need to write a script that prints out the ingredients for us. To spice things up a bit, we'll print the ingredients both in order and in reverse order.

## Challenge

> #### Instruction
> Create a JavaScript file that prints out our ingredients.

Create a new file in your `lighthouse-js-fundamentals` directory in Vagrant called `ingredients.js`, and copy the following code into it.

```javascript
const ingredients = ["eggs", "milk", "flour", "sugar", "baking soda", "baking powder", "chocolate chips", "bananas"];

// Write a while loop that prints out the contents of ingredients:

// Write a for loop that prints out the contents of ingredients:

// Write any loop (while or for) that prints out the contents of ingredients backwards:
```

* Write a loop under each comment in the file. 
* Under the first, write a `while` loop that prints out each item of `ingredients`. 
* Under the second, write a `for` loop that does the same thing. 
* And under the third, write any loop, `while` or `for` that prints out each item of `ingredients` but backwards (that is, the first should be `"bananas"` and the last `"eggs"`).

> Submit your work

Finally, commit your work to your `lighthouse-js-fundamentals` git repo and push it to GitHub.
