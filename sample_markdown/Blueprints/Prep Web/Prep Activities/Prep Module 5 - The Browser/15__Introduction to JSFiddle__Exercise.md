The next few exercises in this module make use of the excellent in-browser coding tool 'JSFiddle'. In this exercise we will be going over the basics of its usage. We will also take advantage of this exercise to quickly learn about the JavaScript 'alert' function.

## Introduction

### What is JSFiddle?

JSFiddle is an online coding tool that allows users to quickly write and run HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in an isolated and configurable workspace called a 'fiddle'. They can then share these 'fiddles' with other people.

> #### Instruction

### How does it work?

As you may have noticed in the fiddle linked above, JSFiddle has 4 distinct panels. Each panel covers one aspect of web development, providing an overview of all of your work.

These panels consist of:

* The HTML Panel 
* The CSS Panel 
* The JavaScript Panel
* The Results Panel - Where you see all of your work come together!

## Let's give it a try!

Now we're going to try out a few small exercises in JSFiddle.

### Forking a fiddle

Before we begin, we need to know how to _fork_ a fiddle.

_Forking_ in JSFiddle creates a clone of a fiddle, moving that clone to its own workspace. This allows people to make their own changes to a fiddle without editing the original. 

To fork a fiddle, you can click the 'Fork' button in the top menu bar.

When you click the fork button, keep an eye on the URL of the page. While the content of the fiddle won't change, you'll notice that the random assortment of letters in the URL will. Those letters uniquely identify a fiddle. When a fiddle is forked, a new identifier is created for the new fiddle.

### Writing HTML and JavaScript in JSFiddle

Time to test it out!

> #### Instruction
> Fork the following fiddle, and follow the instructions in the HTML and JavaScript panels. Don't close the tab when you are done! We'll have more to do when you get back!

### Showing the results of our JavaScript

So, you wrote some HTML and JavaScript. The HTML we can see in the results, but the JavaScript is just...there. 

Is there a way we can test our variable?

Later in this prep module we will be teaching you how to find and change HTML elements with JavaScript. For now, we'll make use of a handy little function called `alert`.

The `alert` function creates a small pop up that contains whatever text you pass to it. 

Return to your fiddle and add the following line of code to the JavaScript panel. Then click 'Run' and see what happens!

```javascript
alert(helloWorld);
```

Neat! This alert function will come in handy down the road.
