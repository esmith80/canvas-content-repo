Throughout this course, you will be interacting with git almost exclusively through the command line. In this activity you will practice entering git commands using the Try Git app built by the Code School team.

## Practice

Time to get your feet wet. The best way to learn how to use git is to simply start using it.

But before jumping into our Vagrant VM and entering the world of "real git", let's first take some time to practice it in the browser.

### [GitHub - Git-it Tutorial](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/releases)

<https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/releases>

The above link takes you to the Git-it tutorial app. 

> #### Instruction
> Download and install the correct version for your machine, and complete the challenges up to 'Forks and Clones'. 

You don't need to go any further than that just yet. We'll be covering the more advanced topics later.

GitHub has sponsored this interactive app which teaches you how to use git on your machine. In this way you can experiment with real git commands in a real terminal and have the app verify the results.
