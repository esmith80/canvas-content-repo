In this module you will learn how to manage your code using Version Control (aka Source Control), an essential yet complex topic. You'll only be focusing on the fundamentals that you need to get going instead of diving deep into advanced commands or theory.

You'll also learn about the difference between git and GitHub whilst using basic git commands to save your work locally and on GitHub.

> #### Warning
> Unless otherwise stated, all work and commands should be run within your Vagrant (guest) machine, and not your host machine.

Onward!
