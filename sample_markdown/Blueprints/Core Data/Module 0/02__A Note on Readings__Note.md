Readings are provided to introduce new concepts, giving you material that you can refer to as you work through exercises.

Some readings include code examples or even step-by-step tutorials. It can be good practice to follow along with code examples by writing the code. However, we often give readings *before* exercises (and even lectures), and they don't always provide all the context you might need to code along with them. The important thing is that you read them.

If you do code along with a reading and you get stuck, just finish the readings and move on to the exercises, which have more tailored instructions. You can always go back to the reading later.
