You will have the opportunity to test yourself and take quizzes throughout the course. Quizzes are usually presented at the end of a section (but sometimes in the middle as well). However, if you are feeling tired by the time you get to a quiz, we suggest rather taking it later but prior to the next lecture.

They should only take about 10-20 minutes to complete.

Please, also remember that the quizzes are meant to be **taken individually, not in pairs and without assistance from resources and notes**. Only then can they be considered fair and accurate assessments of your understanding.
