This doc is here to help set expectations for how all of us, including yourself, are expected to operate. We covered a lot of this in our introductions but still encourage you to read this in full. Believe us, it's quite important.

### Course Goal: Learn to Think Like a Data Scientist

Our main goal for the program is to get you to a point where you can think like a data scientist and continue to learn on your own. The way we designed our program isn’t to teach you everything there is to know to become an expert (that takes years of practice). It’s designed to teach you how to approach problem-solving, data cleaning, and machine learning problems so you are employable and able to contribute in your first role.

### Some General Things to Keep in Mind Throughout the Course:

Be comfortable with being uncomfortable.

When you are tired, frustrated and stressed, remember that the program is designed for the following outcomes:

* Get you ready to work in data science
* Help you develop and improve your grit
* Encourage you to use online tools (i.e. Google, StackOverflow, etc.) and help you become an independent problem solver

Ask for help! If you want or need something (assistance, approach, and code reviews, an ad-hoc breakout, etc.), ask for it! If you are having a problem, come talk to us!

### The 20/80 Rule:

Your success is 20% determined by us and 80% determined by you. While we provide the structure and guidance, only you can do certain things that are necessary for you to succeed in the program. Put in the hours and hard work, as your outcome will be determined by the effort you put in. Learning is an active process.

### Imposter Syndrome:

Did you know there's a well-documented phenomenon in which highly qualified people go through life feeling like they're a bunch of frauds and don't deserve the things they've achieved? It's very common for students to feel that way during their learning journey, if it gets overwhelming please come talk to us!

### Send us Your Feedback!

We <3 <3 <3 feedback and try our best to act on it! We try to be as transparent as possible and are happy to explain why we structured aspects of the course the way we did. Our teaching staff will be giving you lots of feedback throughout your learning, so it’s only fair that you get to give us some as well :)

## The Curriculum:

Here's what most days look like:

Morning lecture, Lab work, more Lab work. More specifically, most days Monday to Friday look like this:

10am-12pm PT / 1pm-3pm ET: Lecture

12pm PT / 3pm ET: Start working on daily assignments

After a few hours, remember to take a break, eat dinner and go for a walk! Then you can come back to your work in the evening with fresh eyes.

On the weekend you will also receive work through Compass, but we will not hold lectures or other scheduled events on Saturday or Sunday

### Mentor Hours

Mentors are typically scheduled as follows:

Monday to Thursday: 10:00am EST - 9:00pm your local time

Friday: 10:00am EST - 6:00pm your local time

Weekends: Limited mentor support

### Duration of the Course

10 weeks of curriculum + 2 weeks to work on your final project.

Demo Day for your final project takes place in the 12th week, on Thursday. 

### Assessment Tests

Tests are one way for us to measure student's individual progress and understanding of the material in the course. While tests are important, they are only one of the data points that are used to evaluate students during the course. We also evaluate students through tech interviews, code reviews, assignment submissions, quiz submissions, and mentor feedback. Failing the test does not mean that you will be forced to withdraw from the program. That's all we'll say for now... more information on it will be provided later.

### Request Assistance!

Our mentors are here to support and guide you, take full advantage of their support! Mentors can be used to review your code, and offer suggestions on how to improve it. This is a great way to push yourself farther in the course. 

**15 Minute Rule**: if you struggle through a problem for more than 15 minutes, please ask for help!

### Prioritize

Don't work on stretch activities until you've completed all the core activities for the section you're on.

### Tech Interviews

There will be four tech interviews, taking place in weeks 3, 5, 8 and 10.

Please keep in mind that due to instructor availability, the time, day, and sometimes even the instructor, will vary for your tech interviews.
