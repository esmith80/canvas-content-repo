## What are Mini Projects?
During this program, you will have several opportunities solve a problem using a combination of tools and concepts. In addition to your mid term project and final project, we have created 5 mini projects. 

These projects will usually take about 1 to 1.5 days to complete. 

## Presenting Your Results
You will present the results from each of the mini projects to your classmates on the Friday of the week it is assigned. 

Presentation skills are one of the most important skills to develop as a data professional. We will start with a simple presentation guideline to follow when presenting the results of the mini-projects.

### Mini Project Presentation Guidelines

Since everyone from the cohort will present, we must keep our presentation **short, simple and to the point**. Focus on explaining 

- what you did
- how you approached the problem and why you approached it that way
- what you achieved, and, if appropriate, suggest what else could be done. 

Each presentation should be no more than **5 minutes**. Note that the number of slides doesn't necessarily determine the duration of the presentation. You can opt-in to do the a demo and share screen for parts of the presentation but be careful with timing and duration. 

Since each mini project has a different goal and output, you will find suggested outlines for each presentation in the mini project activities.
