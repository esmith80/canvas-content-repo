Welcome to your __how-to__ guide for Compass!

In this activity, you're going to learn how to get the most out of Compass.


### The Backstory

Compass was built to be Lighthouse's Learning Management System by alumni from our cohorts in 2014. Now, it is continuously innovated by a team led by our co-founder and Head of Education, Khurram.

The Compass that you now see is what we call "version 2" and was launched in September 2016 to coincide with the start of our JavaScript-focused curriculum. However, it is by no means the last version, as we are constantly iterating to make a more data-driven, maintainable, and multi-tenanted platform.

### How Compass is now used

While you will be using Compass primarily to access your curriculum and request assistance, Compass is also used to track things like curriculum quality, instructor and mentor helpfulness, student progress, and more. All of this data allows us to continuously improve our program for current and future students.

You will be using Compass throughout the program, and it will be forever available to you once you graduate. The curriculum will unlock gradually as you progress and includes your lecture topics (plus lecture notes and backup videos) and assignments. Within each lecture, there are also back-up video recordings of previous lectures. You do not need to watch these lecture videos. They are simply there in case you would like to review a topic or miss a lecture due to extenuating circumstances. 

> #### Note
> If you find yourself watching lecture videos and wish you could speed them up, YouTube has [video speed controls](https://www.wikihow.com/Speed-Up-YouTube-Videos), or if you want even higher speeds you can try the [Video Speed Controller Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk).


You can access your cohort class list, a list of your mentors, and a list of the projects you will be completing throughout the course. We named Compass pretty aptly, as it will be your guide through several aspects of our program.

Here are the important details that you should know:

### Mark your assignments as "Completed"

Once you finish an assignment, don't forget to mark it as completed. 

If you want to revisit certain assignments or readings that you have completed, still mark them completed and use personal bookmarking tools to keep track of them instead. Do not leave things marked incomplete so that you can revisit them. 

### Requesting Assistance

One of the primary features of Compass is the "Request Assistance" function, with which you will soon become intimately familiar. On the backend, the Request Assistance function corresponds to another feature that mentors see, called "The Queue."

The Queue serves up your questions in the order that they are submitted so that mentors can attend to them in order. The Queue _also_ queues up submitted project evaluations and technical interviews as they come up. Thus, when prompted by Compass, mentors will approach you to help you with your questions, to code review your projects, and to help you practice your tech interviews.

__Pro tip #1:__ If you haven't already, please update your profile in Compass to include a recent headshot so mentors can find you when you request assistance. To do so, please follow [these instructions](/d103280f-586a-4883-b7f4-c3247bd10561).

__Pro tip #2:__ You can, and should, use the "Request Assistance" button to request code reviews on any of your assignments.

__Remember:__ Follow the 15-minute rule! Ask for assistance after spending 15 minutes trying to find a solution for yourself.

### Submitting Projects

When you have completed a project, you are required to submit it. Once evaluated projects are submitted, they will go into a separate Project Evaluation Queue, where mentors will be prompted to do a project evaluation. These evaluations are an opportunity for you to get your code reviewed, and also for 1-on-1 personalized feedback on your work.

We have suggested times for you to hand in these projects and you must submit them all in order to graduate. However, a word of caution: **you are here to become the best developer possible, _not_ to hand in projects on time.** Don't cheat yourself by handing in something unfinished. We will ask you to revisit and re-submit an incomplete project. We'd rather you hand it in a bit late if need be, rather than unfinished.

Once your project has been evaluated, you will receive an email with your mentor's feedback.

### Feedback

One of the coolest features of Compass is that it helps us gather feedback on an ongoing basis. There are 3 ways that we collect feedback:

#### Assignment Feedback

Once you finish an assignment, you will see a box appear. You will also see it at the bottom of the assignment, where you can complete it once or multiple times as you progress through the activity.

Fill it in if you have opinions about the assignment! We use this data to identify weak points in the curriculum. We can average ratings to see which assignments need extra love and read comments to identify problem points. This feedback is super useful to our curriculum team, who is constantly working to improve your learning experience.

The time spent in minutes is required feedback because it is used to automatically update the time estimate for future students. Please keep this in mind and give us your most accurate estimate.

#### Teacher Feedback

After a lecture or assistance, you will be prompted to share your thoughts on your interaction with the teacher. Your feedback will go directly to the Education staff but will be shared **anonymously**. Hearing directly from you allows us to know who is "rocking it" in our community, and who needs more training and support. 

> #### Note
>Your honest feedback is greatly appreciated and valued. Feedback that you provide about an instructor or mentor will always be kept completely **anonymous**.

#### Daily Feedback

The daily feedback form is shown at the bottom of the day's schedule. This is a catch-all category for you to let us know how you're feeling by the end of the day. It doesn't need to be curriculum or mentor specific, but feel free to summarize those daily experiences here as well. You can also provide feedback about this online learning environment, such as sharing about your experience studying remotely.

#### In Sum

You'll see us asking for a lot of feedback in a lot of places. It all has a purpose and you don't need to feel obligated to always fill it out. Simply let us know if you have something to contributeâ€¦ positive or negative!


### Pro Tips for Success

Here are some tips that previous students have found useful:

1. Before you start your day, scan the schedule for the section you're on.
2. Do this for specific assignments too. It can be incredibly useful to know what the end result should look like.
3. If you are ahead: Before jumping onto the next section assignments, seek out a mentor to review and give you feedback on one of your solutions, challenge you on your work, or even just advise you on what to pursue next.
4. If you're behind and you can't finish everything, take a deep breath. You can work to catch up. In these cases, prioritization is your best friend. Seek out guidance from your delivery team. And as a general rule, abide by the 80/20 ratio: Spend 80% of your day on the current section's material and only 20% of your day on catchup. This will help you avoid the trap of falling further and further behind.
5. Remember: You are here to _learn_ so throw your ego out the door. Take chances, make mistakes, and get messy.

Good luck!
