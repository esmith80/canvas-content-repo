Please check your email for Lecture Notes sent by the instructors soon after a lecture or breakout. It will contain a summary from the instructor (in their words) on what was discussed.

We encourage you to read each one as a refresher. They may include things that the instructor didnâ€™t get a chance to mention in the lecture/breakout itself, like follow-up tasks or links to external resources.

You can also view the notes in Compass, within the lecture/breakout activity, once they've been posted.
