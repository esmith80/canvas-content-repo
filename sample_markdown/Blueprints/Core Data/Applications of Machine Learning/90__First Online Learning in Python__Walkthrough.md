In this tutorial, we will create our first **Online Learning algorithm** in Python.


## Online Learning in Python

In deep learning, we can use a pre-trained network and adapt it to our needs. Another term for this strategy is `Online Learning`. Every time we have new data, we can run the `.fit()` method and the network continues to learn. This is the main concept of `Online Learning`.

In fact, we can apply the same concepts to various types of algorithms. We will create our first **online algorithm** in this tutorial.


> #### Instruction
> Download the notebook from [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WcSJAer00efuEqB03P0jCAj-bpFQmhms/view?usp=sharing) and follow the instructions.




## Conclusion

We can see that once we understand the concepts, the implementation of online learning is **not** that complex. We will see more examples of Online Supervised as well as Unsupervised learning later.
