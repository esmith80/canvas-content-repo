In this exercise, we are going to build a GAN network that will generate letters.

## Exercise

> #### Instruction
> The goal is to build two networks, one generator and one discriminator, to create pictures which will contain letters. This is a complex problem, so whenever we feel lost, we can consult with the article [**Generating Letters Using Generative Adversarial Networks**](https://medium.com/ml-everything/generating-letters-using-generative-adversarial-networks-gans-161b0be3c229).
