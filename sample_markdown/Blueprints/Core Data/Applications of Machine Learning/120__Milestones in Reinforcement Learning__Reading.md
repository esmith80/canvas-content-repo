We will now take a look at some major milestones in the evolution of Reinforcement Learning.


## Milestones in Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a part of machine learning that is making many state-of-the-art advancements - mainly in beating the heck out of humans in different games :). We will take a closer look at two of them:

- Chinese game GO (2016)
- Texas Hold'em (2017)

> #### Instruction
> Probably the biggest milestone in this field was when a computer beat a human in a game of GO. You can read about it in the article [**‘Huge leap forward’: Computer that mimics human brain beats professional at game of Go**](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/huge-leap-forward-computer-mimics-human-brain-beats-professional-game-go#).

> #### Instruction
> It took a bit more time for this to happen – a computer finally beat human in poker as well. Make a quick read of the article [**Artificial intelligence goes deep to beat humans at poker**](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/artificial-intelligence-goes-deep-beat-humans-poker#).
