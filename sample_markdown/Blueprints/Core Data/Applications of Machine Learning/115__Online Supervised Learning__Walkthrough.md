Recently, we saw the main differences between traditional (batch) approach and online approach to ML problem. We will begin with some tutorials to practice various algorithms we can use in `Online Learning`.

## Online Supervised Learning

> #### Instruction
> In your own notebook, implement the use-case from the resource [**Out-of-core classification of text documents**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_out_of_core_classification.html).

<!-- -->

> #### Note
> Firstly, you need to use Class that provides to get the data from Reuter's repository.


## Conclusion

We have seen a nice combination of Online Learning and NLP.
