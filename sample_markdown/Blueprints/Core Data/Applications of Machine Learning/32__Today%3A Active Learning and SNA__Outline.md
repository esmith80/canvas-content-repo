**Introduction to Deep Learning**

At this point, we know how to prepare data, create machine learning models, and deploy the solution in the cloud or any other infrastructure. Now, it's time to pull out the big guns and start with some fancy ML topics. 

We will be covering different applications of machine learning, such as Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Time Series Analysis, or Recommender Engines. For now, we are going to start with the introduction to **Deep Learning**.
