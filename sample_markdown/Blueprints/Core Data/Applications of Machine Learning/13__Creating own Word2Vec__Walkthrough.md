In a [previous tutorial](/c39198a2-937e-40dc-99c3-2b5160e1d0d5), we became comfortable with *BagOfWords* and *TfIdf* techniques. Now we will create new  **Word2Vec** models by two approaches:

- from scrath
- from the famous **Gensim** library.

## Tutorial

We start with the `from scratch` approach. This will help us to improve the understanding of how the model is built and how it works. 

> #### Instruction
> Follow the article  [Creating Word Embeddings: Coding the Word2Vec Algorithm in Python using Deep Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-word-embeddings-coding-the-word2vec-algorithm-in-python-using-deep-learning-b337d0ba17a8) to create own *word2vec* model. 



<!-- -->
One of the most popular Python packages for NLP, **Gensim**, will be used in second approach. We will experience how much simpler it is to apply pre-built methods from existing Python libraries.


> #### Instruction
> Follow the steps in the article [**Implementing Word2Vec with Gensim Library in Python**](https://stackabuse.com/implementing-word2vec-with-gensim-library-in-python/) and run the code in your own Jupyter Notebook.
