## Mini-Project V
Are you familiar with the website Quora.com? It is a website where users can ask questions to be answered by other Quora visitors. As you can imagine, with with ~100 million visitors a month there are always going to be duplicate questions. 

For this project, our goal is to identify which Quora questions are duplicates of each other. This could be useful, for example, to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered. So, we are tasked with predicting whether a pair of questions are duplicates or not (you may recognize this as a **binary classification problem**).

More specifically, this project is designed as an opportunity for you to practice applying the following two concepts:

- Deep Learning
- NLP
