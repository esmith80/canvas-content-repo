In this reading, we will learn about `Recommender Engines`, which belong to another branch of machine learning algorithms. 


## What are `Recommender Engines`?

Often termed also as `Recommender Systems`, they are simple algorithms that aim to provide the most relevant and accurate items to the user by filtering useful stuff from a huge pool of information base. *Recommendation engines* discover patterns in a dataset by learning consumers' choices and produce outcomes that co-relate to their needs and interests.

Some examples of *recommendation engine* usage can be found in the following applications:

* Facebook: “People You May Know”
* Netflix: “Other Movies You May Enjoy”
* LinkedIn: “Jobs You May Be Interested In”
* Amazon: “Customer who bought this item also bought …”
* Google: “Visually Similar Images”
* YouTube: “Recommended Videos”
* Waze: “Best Route”
