In the last reading, we discovered two types of `Collaborative filtering.` Now, it's time to try the `Memory-based` approach in Python.

## `Memory-based` approach

The key difference of the *memory-based approach* from model-based techniques is that we are not learning any parameter using gradient descent (or any other optimization algorithm). The closest user or items are calculated only by using `Cosine similarity` or `Pearson correlation coefficients`, which are only based on arithmetic operations.
