Now we will start with **Recommender Engines**. There are numerous approaches to *recommender engines* so we'll spend some time on this topic to cover everything important. Every one of us has probably come across *recommender engines* in one form or another. When we think about buying stuff on Amazon, watching Netflix, or listening to music, the content we see or hear is not shown randomly. Most of the time, there are some algorithms behind that. We will inspect them in this course.


To get properly motivated, we'll first take a look at a well-known Netflix prize challenge that popularized this type of Machine Learning. After that, we will start with two types of recommender algorithms:

- **Content-based filtering**
- **Apriori algorithm**
