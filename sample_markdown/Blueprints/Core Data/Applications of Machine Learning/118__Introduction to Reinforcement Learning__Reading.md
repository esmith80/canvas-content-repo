We're finally going to get to know the last type of algorithm covered in this course: **Reinforcement Learning**.

## Reinforcement Learning

*Reinforcement Learning* is based neither on supervised nor unsupervised learning. It is based on learning from the environment. Let's start with a simple example.

Imagine you bought a new piece of furniture at IKEA. You can use the guide that comes with the furniture and construct it following the steps in it. Once you do that you will be able to build the same type of furniture without the guide. In this case, we just used supervised learning to learn how to build a piece of furniture.

If we lose the guide in the beginning, there is nothing left but to apply a trial-and-error approach â€“ we try to connect two pieces and if they fit we're good. If they don't, we need to go back, change our approach, and try something different. This trial-and-error approach represents the main idea behind *reinforcement learning*.
