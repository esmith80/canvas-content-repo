## Teacher Notes

### Context

- Previously, they learned about deep learning

- We covered a lot of supervised and unsupervised models (regression, classification, clustering,...)
- They are comfortable with Python classes and data preparation in Pandas

### Agenda

The majority of focus should be on:

- In the beginning, we should talk about the purpose of NLP, where to use it, and why use it.
- After the introduction, explain them data text preprocessing (it would be great to show them the most often used methods on a string). Then continue with tokenization, lemmatization, stop words, and so on.
- Explain text data representation, Bag of Words model, and TfIdf.
- Explain the Word2Vec model, how this model uses a neural network, and compare it with TfIdf (pros and cons).

Beside slides and examples, we recommend showing students some simple examples of NLP to motivate them and show that it's not that hard to do "fancy" things and models in Python.
