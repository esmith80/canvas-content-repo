This challenge will test a combination of skills we've acquired recently and we'll have to deal with a complex NLP problem.

## Challenge
The [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) was used to collect tweets with either happy :) or sad :( emoticons. That raw data can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FXl6H34ozvl02_kED-XA1szrCpoRZ5dr/view?usp=sharing). 

> #### Instruction
> 1. Use the happy or sad  emoticons to label the text with either positive (1) or negative (0) sentiment.
> 2. Build a predictive model which will predict the sentiment of a text. We can use any classification technique we've encountered so far.

### Stretch

> #### Instruction
> Deploy your model to cloud so anyone can try it with HTTP requests from their computer.
