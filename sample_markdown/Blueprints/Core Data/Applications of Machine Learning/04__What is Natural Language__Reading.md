Firstly, we will start by introducing what **Natural Language Processing** is and how it differs from traditional Machine Learning problems.

## Natural Language

*Natural language processing* is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. It focuses on how programs and computers process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. **Natural data** consist of:

- Speech recognition
- Text understanding
- Language translation
