Now we will focus on:

- Recommender Engines
- Online Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

We will see various applications of these techniques and how useful they can be. Especially **Recommender Engines**, which have interesting applications in almost any industry from banking to e-commerce and services.

Coming up, we will resume the work we have done and finish **Online Learning**. Furthermore, we will get to know another "fancy" algorithm â€“ **Reinforcement Learning**, which can be considered as online because it constantly learns from the feedback it is given.

We are sure you cannot wait to start, so let's move on!

Enjoy!
