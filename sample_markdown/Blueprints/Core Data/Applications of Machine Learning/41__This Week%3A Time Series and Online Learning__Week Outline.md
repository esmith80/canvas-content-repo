Now we will continue discovering different applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, starting with **Time Series** prediction. The main difference between a typical ML problem and Time Series is that these problems depend on the time, unlike problems we have covered so far, which are time-independent.

Furthermore, we will get introduced to topics like online learning and reinforcement learning, where the model adjusts in real-time to improve its decisions.
