The previous reading explained the idea behind `Time Series` to `Supervised Learning` data transformation. Now, it's time to implement this transformation from scratch in `Python`.

> #### Instruction
> Follow the steps in the article [**How to Convert a Time Series to a Supervised Learning Problem in Python**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/convert-time-series-supervised-learning-problem-python/) and implement the transformation function in your Jupyter Notebook.


## Conclusion

We have learned how to transform a typical time series problem to supervised learning. This technique is often used, for example when we use Deep Learning for time series prediction. We will see an example in the next tutorial.
