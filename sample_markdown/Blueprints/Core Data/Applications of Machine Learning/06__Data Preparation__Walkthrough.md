In the last reading, we have learned what NLP is. Now, we will focus on how to clean and prepare data for NLP. Furthermore, we will combine this reading with hands-on tutorial and we will apply these data-cleaning techniques in Python.

## Tutorial

Correct data preparation is very important for all machine learning techniques, NLP not being an exception. There are many things that need to be taken care of before modeling to maximize its power:

- Tokenization
- Stopwords cleaning
- Removing punctuation
- Normalizing
- Stemming

> #### Instruction
> Follow the steps in the article [**NLP for Beginners: Cleaning & Preprocessing Text Data**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/clean-text-machine-learning-python/) and run the code in your own Jupyter Notebook.
