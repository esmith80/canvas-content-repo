Let's take a look at **Market Basket Analysis** and how we can use it.


## Market Basket Analysis

*Market Basket Analysis* *(MBA)* is a quite simple but very useful technique for finding relationships between various items in different industries, for example in retail, banking, telco or medicine. It belongs to the group of Unsupervised Learning techniques, so we don't need to have any prior knowledge of what we're looking for.

The main use-cases are in retail or e-commerce where it can help with:

- The layout of a store (website)
- The right selection of promotions (we don't want two items frequently bought together on sale at the same time)
- It's a basis for recommender engines.
