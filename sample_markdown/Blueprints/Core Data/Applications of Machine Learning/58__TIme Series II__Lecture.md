## Topics

- FP Prophet
- Conversion of Time Series to Supervised Learning
- Predicting Time Series with LSTMs.

## Teacher Notes


### Context
- They learned about Python libraries (statsmodels) used for TS modeling

- We've covered a lot of supervised and unsupervised models (regression, classification, clustering)

- They are comfortable with Python classes and data preparation in Pandas

- We covered hypothesis testing in the past (and reviewed it recently)

- We covered data preprocessing for modeling (stationarity transformations), decomposition and the Box-Jenkins modeling methodology




### Agenda

The majority of the focus should be on:

- Introduce them Facebook Prophet and when (why) to use it (30 min)
- Explain how can we transform Time Series data to Supervised Learning problem (30 min)
- Continue with modeling Time Series as Supervised learning (mention models which they can use) (30 min)
- Demo how we can use DL for time series predictions (30 min)
