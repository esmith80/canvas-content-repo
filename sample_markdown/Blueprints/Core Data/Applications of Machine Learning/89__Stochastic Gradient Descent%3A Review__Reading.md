We learned about Stochastic Gradient Descent in the `Machine Learning` module. This optimization is used also in Online Learning and is, sometimes, called `Online Gradient Descent`.

> There is a small typo in the video at 9:03. The values for the intercept and slope should be the most recent estimates, 0.86 and 0.68, instead of the original random values, 0 and 1. And at 9:33 the slope should be 0.7.
