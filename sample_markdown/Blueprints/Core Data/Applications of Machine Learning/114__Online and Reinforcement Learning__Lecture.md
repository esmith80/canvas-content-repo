## Topics

- Online Learning
    - How to update models in real-time   
    - Differences from classic learning
- Reinforcement Learning
    - What it is
    - How it works
    - Use-cases

## Teacher Notes


### Context
- Students already know Deep Learning, different architectures and applications in NLP, and Time Series analysis.
- We should show the differences between classic learning and learning from feedback, online or reinforcement learning
- Only an overview. We don't have to go too deep into these topics. It's outside of the scope of the course
- This is the LAST lecture of the course




### Agenda

The majority of the focus should be on:

- Online learning - what it is and how it differs from classic ML (15 min)
- Review of stochastic gradient descent (15 min)
- Reinforcement Learning - intro and achievements (use-cases) (30 min)
- A simple demo of an online algorithm in Python (15 min)
- Discussion with students about different use-cases and what learning should they use (45 min)
    - We can let them choose from all we've covered in the bootcamp
        - Unsupervised
        - Supervised
        - Deep learning
        - Online
        - SNA
        - Reinforcement
        - Time series
        - Recommender engines


We recommend opening with some use-cases, showing some slides with concepts of how it works and then do some case studies, either with slides or in Python.
