We can look at Time Series prediction as another use-case for Deep Learning. Recently, LSTMs have become very popular for Time Series and offer very precise results.

## Using an LSTM Model to Predict Stock Prices

We are going to apply our Deep Learning skills to predict stock prices. A stock price is a great example of time series data and an LSTM network is one of the state-of-the-art techniques for Time Series prediction.
