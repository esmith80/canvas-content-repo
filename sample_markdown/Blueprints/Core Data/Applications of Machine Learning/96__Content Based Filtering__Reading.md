After a short intro and motivation, we will begin our journey to mastering `Recommender Engines` with `Content-based filtering` models. We will also learn how `NLP` can be useful in this type of models.


## Content-Based Filtering

We will stay with movies for now and take a look at **content-based recommender engines**. 

> #### Instruction
> Read the article [**How to build a content-based movie recommender system with Natural Language Processing**](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-from-scratch-a-content-based-movie-recommender-with-natural-language-processing-25ad400eb243) to learn more about *content-based filtering*.

## Conclusion

As we could see in this reading, this is no rocket science. *Content-based algorithms* recommend movies and items based on their content. Who would say, right? :) The biggest takeaway from the article should be the difference between *content-based* vs. *collaborative-filtering-based* algorithms. We will talk about the latter more later.
