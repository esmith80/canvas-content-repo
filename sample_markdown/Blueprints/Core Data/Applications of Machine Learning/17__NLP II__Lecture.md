## Teacher Notes

### Context

- They've studied deep learning
- We've covered a lot of supervised and unsupervised models (regression, classification, clustering)
- They are comfortable with Python classes and data preparation in Pandas
- We covered text preparation (cleaning) and text representation (BoW, TfIdf, Word2Vec)

### Agenda

The majority of the focus should be on:

- In the beginning, we should talk in general about modeling in NLP, supervised and unsupervised models
- Explain them Sentiment analysis (supervised), where it can be used and what models are suitable for this type of task
- Explain topic modeling purpose (Dimensionality Reduction, Tagging, Unsupervised learning), and introduce LDA (no need to explain in too much detail)
