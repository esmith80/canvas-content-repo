Now we will continue with Recommender Engines. Previously, we covered *content-based learning* and *apriori algorithm*. We will now move on to **collaborative filtering**, arguably the most often used algorithm for recommender engines.

We will focus on building an end-to-end recommender engine, combining our recommender skills with deep learning to see how we can leverage them together.
