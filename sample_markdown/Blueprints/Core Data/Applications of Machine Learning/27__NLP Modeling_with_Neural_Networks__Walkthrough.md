We will come back to the deep learning during this tutorial. We will practice how to apply different neural networks architectures to specific NLP problems.

## NLP with Deep Learning

Deep learning plays a huge role in NLP. It's not required but with recent advances in this field, NLP was pushed to another level. Now, we are going to use Keras to solve different tasks.

> #### Instruction
> Follow the steps in t[**his article**](https://realpython.com/python-keras-text-classification/) to compare neural networks and classic ML techniques in NLP tasks.


## Conclusion

We have been covering the basics of NLP. Now, we will have a chance to practice everything once more in the following challenge.
