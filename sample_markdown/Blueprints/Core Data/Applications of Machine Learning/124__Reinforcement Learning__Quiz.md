        answer: "It is about taking a suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation."
        explanation: "Nope. Reinforcement Learning indeed IS about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation."

      -
        answer: "Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning."
        explanation: "Incorrect.They indeed do differ: reinforcement Learning doesn't use training data with labels."

      -
        answer: "Reinforcement Learning is used only for NLP problems."
        explanation: "Correct answer. Reinforcement Learning is NOT used with NLP only."
        correct: true
      -
        answer: "We don't have to use Deep Learning in order to build Reinforcement Learning agent."
        explanation: "Incorrect, We can use much simpler algorithms as well."

  -
    question: "Real-Time decisions, Game AI, Learning Tasks, Skill Aquisition, and Robot Navigation are applications in ..."
    uuid: 332b1be8-9915-4147-bae1-d0b7feea676b
    outcome: 3d87a36b-6880-42ca-b857-c4a5d3c71bf2

      -
        answer: "Clustering"
        explanation: "Incorrect. Clustering won't help us in this type of problems."
      -
        answer: "Classification"
        explanation: "Incorrect. There is too many classes in the Gaming for classification algorithms."
    
      -
        answer: "Reinforcement Learning"
        explanation: "Correct."
        correct: true
        
      -
        answer: "Regression"
        explanation: "Incorrect. Regression won't help us in this type of problems."

    question: "What does 'policy' do in Reinforcement Learning?"
    uuid: ca435eaf-342e-44dd-bf18-4323e464d671
    outcome: 858ec64e-b514-43c2-9aa7-dc0324fc4d22

      -
        answer: "Policy function creates mapping between states and actions."
        explanation: "Correct."
        correct: true

      -
        answer: "Policy function creates mapping between states and rewards."
        explanation: "Incorrect. This function does not map to rewards."
    
      -
        answer: "Policy function creates mapping between actions and states."
        explanation: "Almost correct. This is the inverse of the right function."
        
      -
        answer: "None of the above."
        explanation: "Incorrect. One option is correct."
