We are going to do our first **Market Basket Analysis** in Python.

## Market Basket Analysis in Python

We will use the `mlxtend` package. It's a good package to practice and to understand MBA.

> #### Instruction
> Follow the article [**Market Basket Analysis with Python and Pandas**](https://pythondata.com/market-basket-analysis-with-python-and-pandas/) to practice MBA in Python.

<!-- -->

> #### Note
> The `mlxtend` package has some problems with dealing with huge data. MBA is computationally heavy and we need to think about available computer resources when creating these algorithms.


## Conclusion

We have read about the basics of MBA, plus we implemented our first **association rules** in Python. MBA can be used as a powerful input into recommender engines, which will be covered more later.
