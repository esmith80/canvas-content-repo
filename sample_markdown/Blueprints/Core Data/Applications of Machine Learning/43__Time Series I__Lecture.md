## Teacher Notes


### Context
- The students learned about Python libraries (statsmodels) used for TS modeling

- We've covered a lot of supervised and unsupervised models (regression, classification, clustering)
- They are comfortable with Python classes and data preparation in Pandas
- We've covered hypothesis testing in the past




### Agenda

The majority of the focus should be on:

- In the beginning, we should talk about Time Series â€“ why is this topic important and **what's the main difference  compared to supervised learning models** (data points are ordered)
- Prepare a short refresher of hypothesis testing with a focus on concept and p-values.
- Explain what is stationarity and why we need it, mention Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity
- Briefly explain decomposition of Time Series (no need to spend much time here)
- Explain Box-Jenkins modeling methodology
- Introduce AR, MA, and ARIMA processes briefly.


We recommend showing slides and talking. No need to show students a lot of things in Python, there will be plenty of time for that later.
