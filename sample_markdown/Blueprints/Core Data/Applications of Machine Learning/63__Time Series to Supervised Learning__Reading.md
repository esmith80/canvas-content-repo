We've explored many `Supervised Learning` machine learning models. We've also learned that in `Time Series` modeling we use a different structure of data (rows are ordered) compared to all other models used in `Supervised learning`. 

But what if we can transform `Time Series` data to be suitable for `Supervised Learning` algorithms? This transformation would allow us to use all models from `Supervised Learning` that we already know to predict `Time Series`.
