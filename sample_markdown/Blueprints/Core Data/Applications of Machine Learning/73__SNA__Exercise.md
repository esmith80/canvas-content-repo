## Conclusion

We have learned the basics of SNA. It is a huge subfield of Machine Learning that can be used in many industries. We have primarily focused on important concepts and how to apply them in Python. Using these concepts, you should be able to solve any Network challenge you may come across in your career.

It's important to keep in mind the main concepts:

- Building the Network (What are the edges/nodes?, directed/undirected)
- Tie Strengths (What do they represent?)
- Key Players (node metrics)
- Cohesion (network metrics).


Don't forget that if needed, you can always google different metrics :). And now, let's move on to something fancier: `GANs`.
