In the previous tutorial, we were working on `Memory-based Collaborative filtering` with `Python`. Now, we are going to explore a new library called `Scikit-Surprise`.


## Tutorial

This cool library is quite handy when building `Recommender Engines`. We will implement `Model-Based` approach in this tutorial.

> Follow the steps in [**Tutorial: Practical Introduction to Recommender Systems**](https://blog.cambridgespark.com/tutorial-practical-introduction-to-recommender-systems-dbe22848392b) and run the code in your Jupyter Notebook.
