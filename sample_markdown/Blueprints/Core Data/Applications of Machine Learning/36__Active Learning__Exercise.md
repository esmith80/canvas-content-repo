We are going to practice the main concepts of `Active Learning`.

## Exercise


The concepts of Active Learning can be applied to any algorithm â€“ we don't have to use Deep Learning for that. In this exercise, we will practice the concept behind using a simple SVM predictor and [**Titanic dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).



> #### Instruction
> Download [**this notebook**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/197lWrcxQMWjKgdU7-QwTltE6GmH0bgEL/view?usp=sharing) and play around with the Active Learning approach for the described problem.


## Conclusion

We have seen that we don't need anything too complex to practice Active Learning. The important thing to keep in mind is that it makes sense to use it as long as it would be too expensive for us to find labels for classic supervised learning. This will help us choose the observation that will improve our model the most.
