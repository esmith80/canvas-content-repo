**Fundamental Friday Again!**

We will have the opportunity to apply all the skills we recently learned in an upcoming mini-project later on.

For now, we're going to focus on fundamental career-relevant soft skills that are **super important** for every one who is planning to look for a job in the near future. This, of course, goes beyond data science and it is always useful to know the basics of what to do.

You'll see all of this will come in handy both later on in your career!

This skill is **super important** for every good data scientist. We often have to communicate complex topics and results to people who are not too familiar with the methods and algorithms that we use but they need to trust the results because they are the base for taking important decisions. Therefore, we must know how to present our work. This, of course, goes beyond data science and it is always useful to know the basics of public speaking.

We have the opportunity to speak about our results during mini-projects and mid-term projects, and now we're going to bring in some theory and a bit more practice.

You'll see all of this will come in handy both in this course and later on in your career!
