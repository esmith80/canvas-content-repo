**Fundamental Friday Again!**

This Fundamental Friday is going to be slightly different. Recently we have learned many interesting applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. We've started with a complex mini-project and we have some time to finish what we need. 

We can take this as one of the last chances to present our project results before presenting our **Capstone projects** in front of a public audience. Focus on your presentation, prepare nice slides, and ask for feedback from others. 

Let's get back to finishing the mini-project! :).
