The goal of this tutorial is to create our own GAN network in `Python` using `Keras`. We're going to solve a complex Deep Learning problem by understanding existing Python code and applying Adversarial Learning using `GAN`. 

## GAN Tutorial

> #### Instruction
> Start Jupyter notebook with TensorFlow preinstalled using Docker.

<!-- -->

> #### Note
> We will be able to run the code even without GPU but the training step will take a bit longer. 

Now, let's get to work. 

> #### Instruction
> Watch the tutorial video below. Stop the video when needed and follow the code in your own notebook.

You can find the code from the video [**here**](https://github.com/jeffheaton/present/blob/master/youtube/gan/gans_scratch.ipynb) to get the full picture. We strongly suggest that you DON'T JUST COPY-PASTE everything to your notebook and run it. Type it in instead and think about what different parts do.

> #### Note
> There are a couple of things you need to be aware of:
> 
> - Some of the datasets which are linked in the code aren't available anymore. We have collected some pictures and stored them [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TBsfh209zXPg0h4U7XKal1TiJiOBETwh/view?usp=sharing). We can use this data.
> - The code is using Google Colab and storing data on Drive. The same code can be used to store the inputs and results on a PC which we use for training.
> - Use a smaller number of epochs and batch_size to make sure that we finish the training. Even when the quality of the created pictures will be lower.

## Conclusion

It can be a lot of fun to play around with this type of Deep Learning. Do you have any ideas about what we could generate next?
