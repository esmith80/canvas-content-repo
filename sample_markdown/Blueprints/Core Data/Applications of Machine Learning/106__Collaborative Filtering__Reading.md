In this reading, we will dive deeper into the `Collaborative filtering` technique, which is widely used in recommender engines. 


## Collaborative Filtering

There are two main types of `Collaborative filtering`:

* Memory-based
* Model-based

The resource below also contains some Python code. At this point, it's unnecessary that we run this code on our own but it's good to think about what the different parts of it do. The overall focus should be on the theoretical background of how *collaborative filtering* works.
