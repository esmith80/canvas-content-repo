## Introduction to NLP

There are many fields where Deep Learning techniques present additional benefits over traditional predictive modeling algorithms such as regression or decision trees. For example, **Natural Language Processing** or Time Series Analysis. We will be discussing these topics, starting with **Introduction to NLP**.

**NLP** is a huge subfield of artificial intelligence, which deals with applying different ML techniques to "natural" data. We will talk about various use-cases and approaches in this course.

Let's get on with it!!!
