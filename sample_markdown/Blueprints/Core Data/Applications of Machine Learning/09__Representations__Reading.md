So far we have learned how to clean and preprocess text data before applying NLP algorithms. However, since all NLP Machine Learning models work with numerical data, we also need to focus on how to transform the preprocessed text into numerical features.

## Representations

NLP models are no exception â€“ like any other machine learning model, they need to see numbers to create something meaningful. We are going to learn how to do this transformation.

We will explore two ways this can be done: 
* `Bag-Of-Words` 
* `TF-IDF` (Term frequency-Inverse document frequency)
