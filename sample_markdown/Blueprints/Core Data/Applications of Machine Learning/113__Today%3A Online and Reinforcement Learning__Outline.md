Hello!

There's a huge milestone waiting for us. This is the last section of the course when we'll study new content about Machine Learning algorithms. Coming up, we will begin working on **the capstone project**. But don't worry, the mentors will still be available to help you even when you decide to revisit some past topics in order to use them in the final project.

For now, we will build upon our recent work and continue with Online Learning â€“ we will see two more examples of Online Learning using the `sklearn` library.

We will also introduce **Reinforcement Learning** which is a special type of learning considered to be somewhere between supervised and unsupervised learning. It is also often considered "online" because it uses constant feedback from the environment to improve its quality. 

So that's it for the introduction and let's get to work. Enjoy!
