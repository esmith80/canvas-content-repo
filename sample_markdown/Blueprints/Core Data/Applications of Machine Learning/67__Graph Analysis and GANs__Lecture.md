## Topics

- Graph Analysis
    - How it differs from classic learning
- GANs 
    - What is it?
    - How does it work?
    - Use-cases

## Teacher Notes


### Context
- Students already know Deep Learning, different architectures, and applications in NLP and Time Series analysis.
- They also became familiar with the basics of graph analysis, so we can go through that briefly during the lecture and show them some examples.




### Agenda

The lecture should be split into halves: 
- 1 hour should be spent on Graph analysis
- 1 hour on GANs
