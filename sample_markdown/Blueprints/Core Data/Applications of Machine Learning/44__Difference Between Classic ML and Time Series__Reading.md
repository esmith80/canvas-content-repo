Previously, we spent a lot of time with various ML models. Now we will begin with another interesting field of Data Science called `Time Series Analysis`.

## From ML to Time Series

In the beginning, we are going to check how a *Time Series* problem differs from the classic ML problem.

> #### Instruction
> Read the article [**What Is Time Series Forecasting?**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting/) to learn the basics of *Time Series Analysis* and how it differs from machine learning.


## Conclusion

So, the "only" difference between *Time Series Analysis* and classic ML is that data are time-dependent. This property can be very powerful when used wisely and we will learn more about it in detail.
