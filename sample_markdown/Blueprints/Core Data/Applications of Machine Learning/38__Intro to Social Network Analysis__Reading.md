Now we will study `Graph Analysis`, sometimes also called `(Social) Network Analysis`.

## Introduction to Network Analysis

*Network Analysis* is immediately associated with Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter but it is so much more. There are many less traditional social networks:

- The set of individuals with whom one makes regular money transactions.
- The set of people with whom one is regularly on the phone.
- The set of people with whom one regularly exchanges gifts (e-commerce).
- The set of people with whom one shares media content.

The main difference between Network *(Graph) Analysis* and a traditional ML approach is that in classic ML, we look at different observations independently. In *Graph Analysis*, we look at observations through the relationships among them.
