Now we will introduce **Market Basket Analysis** and **Online Learning**.

*Market Basket Analysis* is simple unsupervised learning that looks for relationships between different items based on their occurrence in shopping baskets of consumers. 

The main application is in retail, where we can find out what items clients usually buy together. One of the biggest protagonists of this analysis in the past was Walmart. We might have heard about their famous case study where they found out that [**beer and diapers are frequently bought together**](https://bigdatabigworld.wordpress.com/2014/11/25/beer-and-nappies/).

Furthermore, *market basket analysis* can be used as an input for **recommender engines**, which we will talk about more later.

We will also introduce the concepts and examples of *Online Learning*, which is a very useful extension of traditional (batch) machine learning algorithms.
