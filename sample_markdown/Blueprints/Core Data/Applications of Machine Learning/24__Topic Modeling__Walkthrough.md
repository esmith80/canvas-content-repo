In this tutorial, we will apply LDA, the model we have learned about in the previous activity, to assign topics to news articles in Python. We will also try the new visualization package **pyLDAvis**.


## Tutorial

> #### Instruction
> Follow the steps in the article [**NLP-A Complete Guide for Topic Modeling- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using Gensim!**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nlp-a-complete-guide-topic-modeling-latent-dirichlet-sahil-m) and run the code in your own Jupyter Notebook.

<!-- -->

> #### Warning
> Section `#8. Model improvement` is **OPTIONAL** because the code can take hours depending upon our machine and the combination of parameters we choose to grid-search.
