We're going to apply deep learning to create a more complex agent in Python.

## Tutorial

We will build our agent using deep learning and compare it with the initial approaches we tried in the previous tutorial.

> #### Instruction
> Continue with the article [**Reinforcement learning tutorial using Python and Keras**](https://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/reinforcement-learning-tutorial-python-keras/). Pick up where we left off, i.e. from the heading `Reinforcement learning with Keras`, and build your agent using Deep Learning.


## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have seen the advantages that Deep Learning can bring to the field of Reinforcement Learning.

Now, we are ready to create something on our own.
