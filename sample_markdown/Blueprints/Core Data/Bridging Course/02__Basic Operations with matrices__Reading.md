In the prep course, we covered the basics of what vectors and matrices are. We're now going to look at various operations that can be done with them. This is very important in different stages of machine learning algorithms.

> #### Warning
> Pay attention which types of objects (vectors, matrices, or scalars) each operation applies to and what type of object each operation produces.

We did cover the basic matrix operations during the prep course and we can review that [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RkRTASin_SCEQyWVNxytnB4VL8ryHX9z/view?usp=sharing).

> #### Note
> We can consider a vector **v** with _x_ coordinates (**v**=[v<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>2</sub>,...,v<sub>x</sub>]<sup>T</sup> ) as a matrix **M** with *x* rows and 1 column. Thanks to this, we can focus only on matrix operations in general.

## Operations with Matrices: The Math Behind Machine Learning Algorithms

The following reading covers the operations with matrices in a great detail. These are the concepts we need to primarily focus on:

* _Inner product (dot product)_
* _Matrix addition, subtraction, and their properties_
* _Matrix multiplications and their properties_
* _Square matrices_
* _Matrix transposition_
* _Symmetric matrices_
* _Identity matrices_
* _Determinants_
* _Inverse matrices_
* _Rank_


> #### Instruction
> To learn more about operations with matrices, read the [**Introduction to Matrix Algebra I & II**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WmHZfacI4Ew0n5jZkEjpnlxuArTNsiPo/view?usp=sharing).

> #### Note
> Try to fully understand all of the concepts mentioned in this section. We will use them in programming exercises later in the course. But don't worry if you don't. Feel free to discuss them with us. There are also additional resources in the following sections that will help us to learn about the most important things from a different perspective.
