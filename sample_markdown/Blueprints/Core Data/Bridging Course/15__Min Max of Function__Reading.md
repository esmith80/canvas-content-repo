In this reading, we will learn how we can look for _the minimum_ and _maximum_ of functions using the slope of a graph and derivatives.

## Minimum and Maximum Values

> #### Instruction
> Follow [**this short lesson from Khan Academy**](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/in-in-grade-12-ncert/in-in-playing-with-graphs-using-differentiation/copy-of-critical-points-ab/v/relative-minima-maxima) about identifying the minimum and maximum values.



## Conclusion

We have learned how to look for _the minimum and maximum values_. This skill is used in all machine learning algorithms, more specifically, in an optimization technique called `gradient descent`. We will talk more about it later on.
