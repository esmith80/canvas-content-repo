## Welcome to another FF!
Previously, we reviewed our knowledge of probability and statistics. We will continue with mathematics and this time, it's going to be all about Linear Algebra.

It is quite an abstract and complex topic and it often requires a couple of university courses to master. We selected an interesting and diverse pool of resources to make it as easy as possible but we have to stress: _Take your time when you go through them and ask questions if you are not sure._ Don't feel intimidated when you go through the materials and don't understand something because that happens to all of us :).
