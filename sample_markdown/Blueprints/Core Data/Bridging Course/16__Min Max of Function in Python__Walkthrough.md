We will take a look at how to do optimizations in Python with the `SciPy` package.


## Tutorial

This tutorial consists of two parts:

- Clustering
- Optimization

We have started with clustering this week and we're going to see another example where `k-means` can be useful. 

Furthermore, we're going to look at an optimization example to find the value of stock to maximize our profit.


> #### Instruction
> Open your Jupyter Notebook and follow the tutorial from [**this article**](https://realpython.com/python-scipy-cluster-optimize/).


## Conclusion

We have seen how powerful optimization can be. And this is only the beginning. Coming up, we will start uncovering the power of Machine Learning, how it works, and how it helps us.
