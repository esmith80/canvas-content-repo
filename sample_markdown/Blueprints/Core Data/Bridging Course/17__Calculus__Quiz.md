        answer: "Derivate the function with respect to x."
        explanation: "Correct."
        correct: true
      -
        answer: "Integrate the function with respect to x."
        explanation: "Incorrect. By integration we obtain area under function."
      -
        answer: "It is not possible to find the slope."
        explanation: "Incorrect, it is possible using calculus."
      -
        answer: "None of the above."
        explanation: "Incorrect, one option is correct."

        explanation: "Correct, but there is more than one correct option."
      -
        answer: "x=0 is a global minimum."
        explanation: "Correct, but there is more than one correct option."
      -
        answer: "Derivation of f(x) is equal to zero for x=0."
        explanation: "Correct, but there is more than one correct option."
