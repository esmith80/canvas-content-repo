By definition **data collection** is _"the process of gathering and measuring information on variables of interest, in an established systematic fashion that enables one to answer stated research questions, test hypotheses, and evaluate outcomes."_  

If that sounds overly complicated, let's break it down. We can think of this process like baking a cake.

### 1. Finding the recipe = asking a question

If we don’t know what we want to do with our data, it’s of no use. It’s like shopping without looking at a recipe and later wondering, why lots of the important ingredients are missing. 

### 2. Gathering the ingredients = collecting the data

Now that we know what we want to make, it’s time to a) check what we already have in the fridge and b) see what we need to get from the grocery store. When it comes to data, this includes seeing what data we already have and what else we need to collect. In some instances, data will have a shelf life and we may need to recollect to get the most up to date information. 

### 3. Baking the cake = interpreting and presenting our results

Here is where everything comes together and we attempt to answer our questions with our data, then we put some icing on it and feed it to our stakeholders!

We can further simplify the process into three steps.

### 1. Defining the data sources

In this step, we need to determine where we are able to collect our data from. Do you have an analytics system? How do you track customer data? Do you send out consistent surveys? Where do you track user behaviour? 
Below are just a few examples of data sources we might want to collect information from:

### 2. Defining the metrics

Depending on the amount of data we are collecting, we may be limited in what we can work with. We can only collect **so** much data after all. Good data analysts know that analyzing the data is the easy part. The hard part is deciding what data matters. Metrics set the parameters for the data your organization will use to measure performance. Looking to measure the success of a piece of content you put out? You could look at `number of views`, but a better metric might actually be `number of shares`.  The metric you might look at this this scenario all depends on your definition of success. 

### 3. Getting that data!

Once we have finalized our plan, we can implement our data collection strategy and start collecting data. Data retrieval can happen in a number of ways. Often we will be able to access data by directly downloading it in a spreadsheet from systems like a CRM, HRIS or Google Analytics. But in some cases, as if often the case with customer or in-app data, we may require the help of a developer, data engineer or data analyst to retrieve it.
