## Identifying Outliers Using Mean & Standard Deviation

In class we covered an example of identifying outliers using the mean and +/- 3 standard deviations. We only looked at **quantity**. In this assignment, we'll ask that you look at the same for **profit** and **sales**

> #### Instruction
> Using the `mean +/- (3 * standard deviations)`, determine if there are any outliers in the **sales** or **profit data**.

Input what you find below:

????outliers-stats
- Sales above $7270 is an uncommon occurrence so **Observation #18** with a Sales value of $7958 is an outlier 
- Profit greater than $2429 is also uncommon, allowing us to identify two outliers â€“ **Observations #18 and #82**
????
