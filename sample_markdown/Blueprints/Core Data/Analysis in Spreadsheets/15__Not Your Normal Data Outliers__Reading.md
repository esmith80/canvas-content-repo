## What are outliers?

Outliers are points that differ significantly from the rest of our observations. Identifying outliers is important because they may:

1. Bias our statistical analysis.
2. Signify errors or issues with our data quality.
3. Provide insights about interesting or special cases!

## How can we identify them? 

- Sorting and ranking data
- Descriptive statistics
- Histograms and standard deviation
- Scatter plots
- Interquartile Range and box plots
