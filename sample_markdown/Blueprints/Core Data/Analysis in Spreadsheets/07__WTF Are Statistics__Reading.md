## What are Statistics?
**Statistics** is a collection of principles and parameters for gaining information in order to make decisions when faced with uncertainty. It is a fact or piece of data from a study of a large quantity of numerical data.

When it comes to data analysis, we are only as good as the questions we ask. Statistics is the art of connecting numbers to these questions so that the answers evolve. To establish quantitative connections to largely qualitative questions is the ❤️ of statistics and to make decisions based on **data** not only on **instinct**.

### How Are We Going to Use This?
Statistics are not glamorous: it is about being careful with our data. It counterbalances the magic-unlocking aspects of data analysis. It is asking skeptical questions like:
Are we sure that cool result isn't just noise?
How was this data gathered? Is the sample biased? If it is, what can be done about that?
How many metrics did we look at before arriving at that amazing finding? A lot? What can we do about that?
Could something other than causation explain why X and Y move together? How can we control for other factors Z that might be involved?

### Types of Statistical Analysis
Descriptive: 
- Describes the characteristics of a data set in the form of coefficients, tables and graphs.
    - Average temperature, average height and weight, average sales per month  
- Inferential:
    - Asks a hypothetical question about the **population** and finds the answer by testing a smaller **sample** of data using descriptive statistics.
Opinion polls, predicted sales, volume for a new product, customer surveys

### Population vs. Sample
Take a look at the following image, which shows the relationship between Population and Sample data.

The population is defined based on your problem. The population could be the entire population of a country, or it could be all of your current customers. Rather than analyzing the whole population, most analyses are based on samples.The results from the analysis of the sample are used to infer the behavior of the population.

If your population consists of 10,000 people, your sample might consist of just a few hundred – i.e. a survey of a sample of your customers. Equally, if you produce 10,000 products a day, you will take a sample to analyze performance, identify rates of defects etc.

When performing inferential statistics it is important to make sure your sample size is large enough to be statistically significant. For example a sample of 10 from 10,000 would not be enough to provide reliable estimates.
