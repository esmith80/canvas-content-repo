## Data Types 

Before we dive head first into data analysis, it's important that we understand the basics of our data. Starting with the concept that different types of data require different types of statistical and visualization approaches. It's crucial that we understand how to classify the data we are working with before we start doing any sort of analysis.


### What data types do we have?

- **Categorical**: Observation that be sorted into **categories** or **groups**. Values can be counted but not measured.
- **Numerical**: Observations can be counted or measured. There is an order and the interval between numbers has meaning.

![Graphic shows categorical and numerical data. Categorical can be nominal, with labelled categories, grouped, not counted. Examples are marital status, political party or business unit. Ordinal data is another type of categorical data, and is labelled categories, ordered or on a scale. Interval is not constant. Age group, letter grade, or likert scale are examples. For numerical data, there is discrete date, which are distinct, countable values. For example, number of orders, or of employees, or test scores. Continuous data is another type of numerical data, which is any value including fractions, and the interval has meaning. Value of sales, market price, or time are examples]("https://i.imgur.com/Dur6XCz.png")

Before you begin your analysis, make sure you understand what types of data you have, because the type of analysis you can perform is dictated by the type of data you have to work with.

> #### Download the [Employee Data dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t2GL9-Qwc8nbWxa3I-a8xFT8NzsV-JCx/view?usp=sharing), a dataset about employees working at a company XYZ, and open it in Excel.
> Spend a few minutes exploring the different columns in the spreadsheet and their values (tip: use the filter option from the data tab). Refer to the [data dictionary](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/hr-analytics-case-study) to have a description of the data.

> #### Determine the different data types for each column.

> #### Once complete, download the following solution and open it in Excel to compare your answers.

> #### Warning
> The data that are continuous donâ€™t necessarily have decimals. We can still say that the average of **Age** is 30.5 or we can round it to 31. It all depends on the way you interpret the data and if the intervals are meaningful or not in your data analysis.

> #### If you want to know more about data types and their importance in statistics, you can take a look through this article from Towards Data Science. It covers the different types of data we might encounter as well as what types of analysis and visualizations are appropriate for each.
