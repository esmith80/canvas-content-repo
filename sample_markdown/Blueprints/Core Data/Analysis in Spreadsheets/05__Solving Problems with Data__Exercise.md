## Group Activity

Now that we know a little bit about the basics of data analysis, it's a great time to start thinking about how we can use this in our own lives or jobs.

> #### Instruction
> As an individual, answer each of these questions in a GoogleDoc and submit a link to it via Slack when you mark the assignment complete.
> 1. What type of data do you currently collect in your role?
> 2. What type of data analysis (if any) do you currently do?
> 3. What type of data analysis would you like to start doing in your role?
> 4. What types of problems would you like to solve with data?
> 
>If you do not currently work in a role where you use data or perform analysis, think about a past role where you did, or a future role and how you'd perform.
