Before we can start collecting data there are a few things we need to do. The Data Analysis process really starts with asking the right questions. 

As Einstein once said:

_"If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on it, I would use the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes."_

When it comes to asking questions of our data there is no Siri or Alexa living in our CSVs, dashboards or databases. We could stare a spreadsheet all day hoping an answer will pop out at us, but the truth is it won't. Instead we need to start by not just asking the right questions, but asking a lot of them.

## What makes a GOOD question?

Our questions should be:

- Clear
- Measurable
- Concise 

We should design our questions to either **qualify** or **disqualify** potential solutions to our specific problem or opportunity. The most meaningful questions are those that help establish links between different factors and allow us to see underlying patterns. 

## So, what are the wrong questions?

It's easy to fall into the trap of asking questions like:

- "Why are we not making any money?"
- "Where do I find customers?"
- "How can I make my hiring practices more efficient?"
- "How do I increase revenue?"


## What are the right questions?

Instead, we should be developing questions closer to the following: 

- “Which marketing campaign that I did this quarter got the best ROI, and how can I replicate its success?”
- "Is there a co-relation between the retention rate and the age group the employee belongs to?"
- "What are the most productive inbound traffic streams and which sources are we missing?"
- "What are the most influential buckets of content on our website?"
- "How many new loyalty program sign ups did we get last year?"

The article provides a good framework for how to approach problems we want to solve with data. We'll be using this framework to complete our first assignment.
