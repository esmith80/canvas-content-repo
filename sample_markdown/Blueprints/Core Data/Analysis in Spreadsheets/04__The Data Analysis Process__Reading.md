## The Data Analysis Process

Trying to find the cause of a problem in your current job? Data can help, but sometimes knowing how to interpret and explore it can be intimidating. Luckily it can be broken down into a simple process so we can use data confidently, find answers and make smart decisions!

## 1. ASK

During this phase of the process we need to do a preliminary assessment to answer two questions: is this actually a problem? And if yes, what’s the core problem here? Think of this as the data analysis version of ‘a quick web search’ to confirm that yes, this is a problem worth looking into further.

The important part of defining a hypothesis is to think of several assumptions about the cause of the problem and then jot down how you might prove/disprove each one.

For example, you are an HR Manager who has a job posting that is not converting to any successful candidates. Potential questions you could ask include:

- How effective are my hiring practices? (Can’t measure, can’t take action)
- Which recruiting channels bring in the most candidates? (Can measure, can take action, but doesn’t improve effectiveness of hiring practices)
- Through which recruiting channel am I getting the most quality candidates? (Can measure and use to improve effectiveness)


## 2. COLLECT

Here is where we want to start determining where we get our data from and what type we have(more on that [here](/84d4d1ec-c6ad-45bf-b71e-c292a1a3d144))

Common sources of data include:

- Survey results
- Transaction records
- A CRM
- An HRIS
- Google Analytics
- Customer reviews
- Our own observations 

In our example, we might want to collect the following data:

- Number of candidates hired through each recruiting channel
- Performance reviews for each of the candidates hired

## 3. CLEAN

Often data will be incomplete, missing, duplicated or mismatched or we may need to merge data from different systems. There will also often be outliers that could throw off our further analysis. This stage is critical when it comes to performing proper analysis.

- In our example, we will need to collect data from each of our recruiting channels and make sure it is in the same format. This could also include checking for duplicates or missing data.


## 4. ANALYSIS
The exact form of the analysis will depend on the type of data and the business questions we are asking.

In our example we are able to answer the question using **descriptive analytics** to determine if there is a trend in which channel provided the best performing candidates. However, we might revise our question once we have done the descriptive analysis and ask **WHY** one channel is more effective than another, this would mean looking at **diagnostic analytics**. 


## 5. INTERPRET 

As we are interpreting our results we need to consider the following questions: 
- Does the data answer our original question? How?
- Does the data help us defend against any objections? How?
- Are there any limitation on our conclusions, any angles we haven’t considered?

This is also the stage where we choose data visualization techniques, such as tables and charts, which help in communicating the message clearly and efficiently to our stakeholders.

Here are some points we might consider when we interpret the data in our example:

- What time frame and how many candidates were included in the data set? 
- We didn’t look at which jobs they were being hired for.
    - Maybe we do a great job getting quality IT personnel, but are less successful with other positions.
 - We didn’t look at how long they stayed in the position they were hired for
    - Maybe the candidates are overqualified and taking lower positions to get in and move up quickly - is this what we want?
