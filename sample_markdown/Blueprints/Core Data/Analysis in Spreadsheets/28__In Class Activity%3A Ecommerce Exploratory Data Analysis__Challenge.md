Now that we have a _feel_ for our data, there is a lot we can explore before doing any sort of analysis on it.

Answer the following questions by performing some simple exploratory analysis on our data. 

> #### Note
> Feel free to use things like histograms and bar charts to visualize some of the results to questions below. And be sure to ask your instructor for assistance to answer the questions below!


## Questions to ask our data

**1. How many orders were there per month?**

**2. What customers have placed the most orders?**

**3. What countries place the most orders? What if we remove the UK?**

**4. What days are the most orders placed on?**

> #### Note
> You may find this article on [Pivot Tables](https://www.techsoupcanada.ca/en/community/blog/pivot-tables?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhafSh-W15wIVk5OzCh3xsQMsEAAYAiAAEgKCpfD_BwE) helpful in figuring out the answers to some of the questions above.

Here are some of the observations we might have made:

1. November 2011 had the highest number of orders
2. The customer with the highest number of orders comes from the UK
3. Overall, the company receives the most orders from customers in the UK, which makes sense. The top 5 countries (including UK) are United Kingdom, Germany, France, Ireland, Spain
4. The company receives most of it's orders between M-Th

## Summary

By cleaning and performing some basic Exploratory Data Analysis you can see that we've already revealed some interesting insights into our data. It's good for us to get into the practice of understanding our data first, and trying to gather as many insights as we can from it before really getting our hands dirty with analysis.
