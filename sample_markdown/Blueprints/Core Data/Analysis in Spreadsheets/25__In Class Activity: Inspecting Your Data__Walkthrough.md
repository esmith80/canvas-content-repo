## Data Profiling

We want to start our inspection by getting a general understand about the quality of our data by doing things like determining our data types, if there are any missing values, if this data set is linked to (or has a relationship) with another, etc.

Start by answering the following questions:

**What filetype is our data?**

????
It’s a CSV or comma separated values. It’s a text file that uses commas to separate the values and can be opened with spreadsheet programs like Excel or GoogleSheets.
????

**How many rows (observations) and columns (categories) are there?**

????
In this data set there are 16 columns and 40822 rows.
????

**What types of data do we have?**

????
It's important to know what **type** of data each one of our categories holds so we can ensure data integrity. These are called **data-type constraints**, meaning values in a particular column must be of a particular datatype. In this case our views must be an **integer**, our **comments_disabled** must be a boolean.

This will also help inform the type of analysis we can perform on any of the categories by determining which are categorical or numerical.
