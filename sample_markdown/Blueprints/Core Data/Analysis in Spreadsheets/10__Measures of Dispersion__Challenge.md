Now that we know our measures of central tendency, let's take a look at how spread out our data is around them using **measures of dispersion.** 

## Excel Functions for Dispersion

> #### Instruction
> Calculate the basic statistics describing the dispersion of the data for **level of satisfaction** and **weekly viewing time** in this sample using the Excel functions `MAX`, `MIN`, `VAR.S` and `STDEV.S`.

The results should be as follows:

Remember the **RANGE** is calculated by MAX-MIN.

> #### Note
> In this case we used the equations for the variance and standard deviation of a **SAMPLE** as this data is for a sample of customers and not the full population of customers.

## Interpretation

What do our measures of dispersion reveal? Is our data normally distributed? Are there any outliers?
