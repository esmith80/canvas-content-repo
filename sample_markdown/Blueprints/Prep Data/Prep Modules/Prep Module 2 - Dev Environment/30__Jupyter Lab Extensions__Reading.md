## JupyterLab: Extensions

Some of the power of Jupyter Lab comes from its _extensions_. There are lots of _extensions_ available to improve and customize this IDE for everyone.

It was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language. We can read more about `conda` in its [**official documentation**](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html). W
