In this exercise, we will focus on **JupyterLab**. We will get familiar with the environment and learn different tricks that can simplify our workflow.

### Installing Jupyter

In the default Anaconda Distribution, _Jupyter_ is already pre-installed. Therefore, we can simply start it.

### Starting the JupyterLab

> #### Note
> If you are using Linux or a Mac you can find your terminal in your list of applications, or you can simply type "Terminal" into your search bar. If you are using a Windows machine, search for "Anaconda prompt". 

<!-- -->

> #### Instruction
>  Use Terminal and write the command below to start `Jupyter Lab`. 

```shell
jupyter lab
```




This will start a webserver on your local machine and open a window in your browser automatically. It will run on `http://localhost:8888/lab`.
