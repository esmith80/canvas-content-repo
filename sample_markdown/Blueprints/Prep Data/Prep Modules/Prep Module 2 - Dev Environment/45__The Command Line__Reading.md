We'll now take a short break from JupyterLab and explore another interface that will be used quite often: `the terminal (i.e. the command line)`.


## The Command Line

This wonderful document is the perfect gateway to _the command line_. Along with a code editor (VS Code), this is another one of the primary tools that we will be using all of the time.

> #### Instruction
>  Read the [Introduction to the Command Line](https://launchschool.com/books/command_line/read/introduction#briefoverview) and keep in mind that it is all about practice. Don't just read the document trying to remember all the information - follow along with the examples by typing them out yourself to see the results.
