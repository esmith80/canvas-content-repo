In this reading, we'll explain what the **Anaconda distribution** of Python is and why we chose it for this bootcamp. 

> #### Instruction
> Visit [**the Anaconda webpage**](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to find some basic information about the distibution.

Keep in mind that _Anaconda_ is NOT a replacement for classic Python. _Anaconda_ is only a distribution (i.e., something like a version) of Python, so we will still be using Python throughout this course.

> #### Instruction
> Read this article on the [**Difference between Anaconda programming and Python programming**](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-anaconda-and-python-programming/) to see how _Anaconda_ differs from Python.


## Conclusion

We've seen that the most important difference between _Anaconda_ and Python is that _Anaconda_ is a Python and R distribution for data science and machine learning, while Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Now that we know this, we can move to the next step: the installation.
