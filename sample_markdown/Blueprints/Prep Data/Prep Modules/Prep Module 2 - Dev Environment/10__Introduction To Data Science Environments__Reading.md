We are going to start with an overview of different data science tools. As there are many tools presented in this reading, we'll gradually learn more about them and their specifics.


## Introduction to Data Science Environments (IDEs)

> #### Instruction
> Read the following article to learn about the specifics of IDEs, and which IDEs are the most popular: [**Top Python IDEs for data science in 2019**](https://morioh.com/p/a6236d3c9539) 

## Conclusion

We showed you these IDEs because we believe that they really are the most popular and effective ones. However, there are many more IDEs that are not covered here and can still be used. Once you deep dive into the data science field, you will definitely come across the other ones too! We hope you're looking forward to using JuptyerLab - which we'll explore in this module in just a bit so hang tight!
