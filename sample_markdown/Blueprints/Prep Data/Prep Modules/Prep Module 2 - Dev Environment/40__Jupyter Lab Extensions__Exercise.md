## Exercise

In this exercise, we will install useful packages into our `Jupyter lab`.

> #### Instruction
> Install the [**Table of Contents**](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-toc) _extension_ into your `Jupyter Lab`.

<!-- -->

> #### Warning
> Make sure your node version is at least 12 using the command `node --version`. If it is not run `conda install -c conda-forge nodejs` to update.



## Conclusion

We have learned how to install _extensions_ into our Jupyter environment. These can potentially simplify a lot of things for us. There are many _extentions_ we haven't covered here, but don't hesitate to search for and install those as well in case you find them useful.
