Sounds exciting, right? We also can't wait until we get to these cool topics. But first things first: there are some foundations we need to cover before we look at the data, for example:

- Setting up a data science environment
- Intro to Python coding
- Basic mathematics (i.e., probability and statistics)
- SQL

That's why we have created this prep course â€“ so that you can get ready to start your data science journey right away. Enjoy!
