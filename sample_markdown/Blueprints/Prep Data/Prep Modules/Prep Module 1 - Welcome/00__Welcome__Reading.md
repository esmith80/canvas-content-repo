Congratulations on taking the first step on your journey to becoming a data scientist! This short reading will give you some important information about how to interact with Compass and our curriculum.

## About Compass

Compass is our custom-built Learning Management System developed by Lighthouse Labs graduates, staff and teachers. It is in active development and therefore always a work in progress. We're quite proud of it, but we are always open to feedback!

## Your GitHub profile

To access this page, you've already registered for a GitHub account. Make sure you update your [GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) with your full name, picture and other information you'd like to share. This profile will soon become quite important so it's a good idea to start with accurate information.

In order to log into Compass next time, you will again need to authorize your account through GitHub.

## Track your progress

As you make your way through the various activities in Compass, you are expected to mark them as completed using the `Mark Completed` button at the bottom of the activity page (where available).

When marking an activity as complete, you'll need to enter the time you spent on it, which will help us provide future students with better time estimates. The completion form will also ask you for some optional feedback. After completing the form, you will be directed to the next activity.

## Curriculum feedback

We treat our curriculum like a software product and this makes you the end user. We believe in rapid iteration based on feedback and performance, and to that end we greatly appreciate your feedback!

At the bottom of every activity you'll find a feedback form where you can write your comments and, optionally, rate the activity and/or mark the feedback as largely positive, negative, or neutral.

Don't worry about getting all your thoughts down at once â€“ you can submit feedback as many times as you like!

### Proposed feedback workflow

Here is one suggested workflow for providing feedback: as you progress through an activity you can jot down some feedback and preliminary thoughts without providing a rating. Once you've completed the activity, you can use the final feedback form as an opportunity to give it a rating and to add any additional thoughts.
