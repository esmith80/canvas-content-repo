Still not sure if a bootcamp is right for you? Read this to get ready and inspired!

## So you want to take a bootcamp?

You're driven, you're passionate, you're eager to get your hands on a keyboard and start building machine learning algorithms that will take the world by storm. You teach yourself things for fun, you are usually the smartest person in any room you're in, your friends tell you that you should really do something technological. You face problems and view them as challenges, not obstacles. You thrive under pressure, basking in the opportunity to prove that you're capable. You learn by doing, aren't afraid to ask for help, and get lost in tasks that are creative and productive. You want to be a data scientist, and you believe Lighthouse Labs is the place to make that goal a reality.

But enough about you. Let's talk about the program you've chosen. You've chosen to go the bootcamp route, which means that you're going to participate in an educational model that is built very differently from the ones you experienced in high school and/or university. Lighthouse Labs practices a flipped, immersive model of education that puts the emphasis on the development of practical skills through building real-world applications using an incremental and cumulative collection of tools and best practices. Lectures take up a maximum of two and a half hours in any given day, with another eight to ten hours being spent each day working in a lab setting.

You can expect to introduce yourself to new concepts through readings and exercises, getting your knowledge bolstered and backfilled with lectures throughout the week. These lectures will be delivered by top-notch data scientists who have a passion for taking the knowledge, skills, and experience that they have gathered in their data science careers and breaking it down into understandable blocks of information. Your lab time will be supported by a talented group of mentors which Lighthouse has taken the time to bring in to assist you. All will be active data scientists in your community, able to offer their insights into the best way to approach each and every challenge you may be facing.

For ten weeks, you'll show up early and leave late, spending all the in-between hours building projects that can go in your portfolio after you graduate. You will build algorithms you can show off and be proud of, using up-to-date technologies and techniques. You'll be able to demonstrate how well you can work with data.

We have a philosophy of education here at Lighthouse Labs. We believe that you need to know the mechanics of the major libraries and frameworks, and understand their inner workings, before you start applying them and using them to build algorithms. We'll always show you the hard way to do something first, and then give you an easier way, so that you appreciate why the easier way is actually easier and better. You can say that we'll teach you why wheels are round and what tires do before giving you Formula 1 hubs with racing slicks.

Using a popular language like Python, we're going to take you all the way from the basic programming fundamentals, that are the important part of data science skillset, up to the point that you have the skills and knowledge you need to build models for real-time machine learning predictions that can be deployed on a local machine or in the cloud. Along the way, you'll learn important concepts that include probability and statistics, linear algebra, coding and optimization. We will make sure you are ready to enter the work force with the confidence that you can contribute from the first day of your job.

You may have heard of the Stone Soup story, where a family in a village is boiling water and rocks to feed themselves. Each family in the village begins to bring ingredients, contributing what they can until the community is able to produce a rich, luxurious pot of soup that all can share. Lighthouse Labs believes in this philosophy. Each student, each mentor, each staff member, and each instructor is going to contribute something to your education. And each of our graduates will go forth into the data science community and add a new ingredient, something that improves and enriches.

Welcome to Lighthouse Labs. We can't wait to see what you're going to build, and we look forward to working with you on your path to become one of the next generation of data scientists changing the world, one keystroke at a time.
