Before jumping in, it is important that you understand the goals of this prep course and how we are going to achieve them.

## Audience

While anyone can sign up for an account and take advantage of it, this prep course is specifically designed and curated with our data bootcamp students in mind.

Our data bootcamp students must complete the work in this prep course as a prerequisite to the bootcamp, as well as demonstrate an acceptable level of understanding of the material covered.

## Code challenges & quizzes

Among the prep course readings, tasks and exercises, you'll also find code-writing challenges and quizzes. These activities will provide you with the feedback you need to master the concepts and to sharpen your skills.

You will submit code challenges directly in Compass, which will automatically check your work and give you immediate feedback to use as you fix and improve the code, until both you and us are happy with it.

The quizzes will ask you several multiple-choice questions, and once you submit your answers, you'll see your results along with explanations for why each answer option is correct â€“ or not. We strongly recommend you to review the explanations even if you got a perfect score, as they are a great opportunity to reinforce what you've learned or to correct any misconceptions you may have!

## Your new best friend: Google

Don't be afraid to Google things often! When you are googling something related to programming, make sure you give your search some context. For example, if you are trying to solve a problem in Python, ensure that your search includes 'Python'.

## Video tutorials

If you find you would like another explanation of a topic, consider looking up an instructional video. A couple of excellent YouTubers with videos aimed at beginners are [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer) and [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g).

## Try it bootcamp-style

If you'd like to get a taste of bootcamp life, try taking a day where you dedicate about 10 hours to your prep work. Keep in mind:

* The 20/20/20 rule: Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and focus your eyes on something at least 20 feet away.
* Breaks: Being at the computer all day can be rough on your body, be kind to yourself and take short breaks every couple hours. Stand up, do some stretches, get yourself some water and a snack.

These breaks can also help your brain relax so that you can look at your code with new insight when you return. Sometimes a perplexing problem will seem easy after stepping away from it for a few minutes.
