In this reading, you'll find some tips and best practices to keep in mind while working with git and GitHub, as well as some references for further learning and to use as cheatsheets.


## Things to Remember About Git

1. GitHub is a social community. Anything you put on GitHub will be publicly available for the whole world to see (unless you pay for a private account). This is okay. Don't be afraid. But also keep that in mind if you're putting up anything questionable. Your future employers will likely see this code.

2. You've likely heard the phrase Open Source before. GitHub is where a lot of open source code lives. People upload their projects to GitHub in public repositories, where anyone is free to view and use that code. That (and some very specific copyright laws) is what makes that code open source. Eventually, you may give back to the community by fixing bugs or adding features to some of these open source projects, or even create your own open source project and invite other people to help you work on it.

3. Commit often. No one ever wishes they had less commits. Save your files and commit often. Being able to reload files (or even your entire project if you really make a mess of things) to an earlier version is what version control is all about, and you should take constant advantage of it. And on the topic of commits ...

4. Write detailed commit messages. There's little worse than looking back at your code from a month ago, and having absolutely no idea why you wrote what you did. That's when commit messages like `updated database` are going to make you really angry with yourself. It doesn't impart any useful information. Something like `added last names to the User table` is much more descriptive, and gives you a good idea of what the change was, without having to inspect the code.


## References

In case you would like some more material on git, these two guides are a great resource to bookmark and save for later (or if you're curious, to read right now!). Consider them optional.

> #### Note
> These references also cover concepts (like branching, merging, conflicts and tagging) that you won't need to be fully comfortable with until later in bootcamp. For now, you may focus just on the basics.
