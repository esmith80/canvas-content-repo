In this reading, we will learn why **version control** is such an important part of modern data science, and get a high-level understanding of how it works.

While there are many options when choosing which _version control_ system/software to use, we'll be focusing on Git, the industry's current tool of choice.

## Introduction to Source Control

This fantastic writeup gives a good introduction into why _source control_ is important and how Git and GitHub are different things entirely, but can (and often are) used together by many data scientists.
