In this module, we will learn how to manage our code using **version control** (aka source control) â€“ an essential yet complex topic. We'll only be focusing on the fundamentals that we need to get going instead of diving deep into advanced commands or theory.

We'll also learn about the differences between Git and GitHub, whilst using basic Git commands to save our work locally and on GitHub as well.


Onward!
