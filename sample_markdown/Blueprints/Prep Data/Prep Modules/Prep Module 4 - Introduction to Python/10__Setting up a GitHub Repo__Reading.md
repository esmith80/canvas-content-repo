Starting with the exercises in this module, we're going to be writing Python files and committing them to a new Git repository to keep track of them all and to submit the work.

## Creating a New Repo

We will be creating a single Git repo for all exercises in this module. Every single file that we create in this module should be committed to this repo and pushed to GitHub.

> #### Instruction
> Create a new GitHub repo and clone it.

- Log into [**GitHub**](www.github.com) and create a new repository called lighthouse-python-fundamentals.
- Copy the link provided to you by GitHub, then open the terminal on your computer and clone the repo you just created using the `git clone` command.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USER_NAME/lighthouse-python-fundamentals.git
```

- Now, `cd` into the new directory:

```bash
cd lighthouse-python-fundamentals
```

## Conclusion

In this exercise, we've setup a new Git repo. This is where we'll be saving all of our exercise files in this module. Every time a new file is created within this directory, we'll `commit` it to `git` and then `push` it to GitHub.
