The last _control structure_ we will talk about is **the for loop**. It's useful every time we want to apply the same statements to different objects.


## For Loops

A _for loop_ is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).


> #### Instruction
> Follow this [**tutorial**](https://realpython.com/python-for-loop/). We encourage you to type out the commands into your own notebook and play around with those.



> #### Note
> In the past, _for loops_ were often used for applying different operations to a dataset. This made the process quite slow for data with a lot of rows. Nowadays, in Python, we have much better options for this and we will, of course, learn all about them.
