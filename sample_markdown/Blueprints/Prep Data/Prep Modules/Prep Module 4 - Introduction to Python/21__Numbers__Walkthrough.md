We are going to do different operations with numbers, e.g. floats and ints. These operations are quite straightforward because addition will always be addition no matter which programming language we use. The same goes for other operations.


## Numbers - Tutorial

There are a couple of important things we need to focus on and they are clearly explained in the following tutorial. We want to point out one thing: sometimes, these operations change a type of number from `int` to `float`. It can cause some issues in case we don't expect that. 

> #### Instruction
> Although you're already familiar with some basic operations such as addition and multiplication, there are a couple more important mathematical operations to know. Follow this [**simple tutorial**](https://codingexplained.com/coding/python/basic-math-operators-in-python). As always, we encourage you to type out the commands into your notebook and play around with those.

With your grasp of simple math operations, `ints` and `floats` in Python, you're ready for a juicy quiz in the next section.
