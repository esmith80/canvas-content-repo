We already know the data types we can use in Python and how to control the flow of the code execution. Now it's time we take a look at **user defined functions**.

_A user defined function_ is a programmed function that has its parameters set by the user of the system. _User defined functions_ are often seen as programming shortcuts, as they define functions that perform specific tasks within a larger system. They serve to extend functionalities of a programming software that are not available through the built-in functions.
