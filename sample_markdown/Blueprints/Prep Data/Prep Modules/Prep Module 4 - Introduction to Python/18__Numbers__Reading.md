Having learned about strings, there's one more thing that we've got to learn before we are able to see the bigger picture: **the numbers**. Every person knows what _a number is_. What about Python?


## Numbers

What's _a number_? That's kind of a deceptively difficult question for Python to answer (even we would have a hard time to come up with the definition), so let's start by asking an easier question: What isn't _a number_? Well one thing that _a number_ isn't is a string. How do we know? Well, because we can't do string stuff with _a number_:

```python
print(len(2))
print("I would like " + 2 + " milkshakes, please.")
```


Also, some string behaviours work for _numbers_, but they work differently than we would expect:

```python
2+2
"2" + "2"
"2" + 2
```

Or, at least differently than we would expect if we pretended that we knew about string concatenation but not about addition. Actually, the fact that 2+2 results in 4 is quite natural, because that's how _numbers_ work. We can perform things like arithmetic on them, and we don't tend to perform things like string concatenation on them.

So let's revisit the original question: What is _a number_?

And this time, let's call in the [**big guns**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number) for the answer: _A number is a mathematical object, used to count, measure, and also label_.

Bafflingly simple, but if we dig deeper, can we think of anything else that you can use _a number_ for? Telling what year it is. That's just counting. Knowing what Ï€ is, that's just measuring. Having a credit card number, that's just a label. Just kidding, actually, a credit card number is more like a string of digits than _a number_ in its own right. If we read out a credit card number to someone, we don't start reading "Six quadrillion two hundred and eighty three trillion..."

So in Python, we should expect that we should be able to do things to _numbers_ that involve counting, measuring, and labeling. We'll see more about labeling in the Lists section with indices, so for now, we'll be talking about counting and measuring.

## Integers and Floats

`"String"` is a data type in Python. `"Number"` is not... But clearly _numbers_ are a thing in Python. That's why the 2+2 thing worked earlier. It's true that _numbers_ are a thing. But there is no data type called "Number." 

Have a closer look at that error that we got when we tried to add "2" and 2:

Here's what we know from that error:

- It's a `TypeError,` which means that there's a problem with the data type(s) involved
- Python thinks that something that is supposed to be a string (`str`) is not a string
- The thing that is supposed to be a string is something called an `"int"`

It turns out that `"int"` is short for **integer**. In Python, _numbers_ are organized into two types: `Integers` and `Floats`. The reason for this is one of those kind of [**esoteric computer science things**](https://www.dummies.com/programming/c/the-real-difference-between-integers-and-floating-point-values/), which you might find interesting, but absolutely don't need to know for any practical purpose (at least in Python). Here's what we need to know about _the integers_ and _floats_:

- _Integers_ are whole _numbers_, positive and negative, like 10, 600001, and -7.
- _Floats_ are _numbers_ with a decimal, like 3.14, 806.63, and 1.0.

That's about it. We are going to be working mostly with _integers_. Sometimes, _floats_ will show up. That's cool, most of the things that we're going to do work the same way for _integers_ and _floats_. If we have _an integer_ and we'd like it to be _a float_, we can just pass it to the `float()` function. The same thing works in reverse. We can pass _a float_ to the `int()` function:

> Try using the `float()` and `int()` functions with different _numbers_ to see how they work.


#### Incrementation
One of the most powerful things about coding is _incrementation_. Suppose you have a value like _x_ = 3, and you want to increase its value by 1. Let's show below how this would be done and then explain what it means: 

```python
x = x + 1
print(x)
```

The output will be 4. The computer reads from left to right and says that _x_ equals whatever _x_ was before plus 1. Of course, this is where computer programming is differs from mathematics. In mathematics, the equation _x_ = _x_ + 1 is not possible because you can bring the variables all to one side and end up with 0_x_ = 1, or in other words, 0 = 1. 

To _increment_ means to increase and to _decrement_ means to decrease. Most coders don't write _x_ = _x_+ 1 as they prefer the shorter notation, _x_ += 1, which means the same thing. 

Let's consider the following task: ask a user to input any integer and decrease its value by 5. Try this out in your notebook:  

```python
anyNum = int(input())
anyNum -= 5
print(anyNum) 
```

If we can increase and decrease values, what more can we do? Yup, you probably guessed it. You can also change a value by a multiple. Try this out in your notebook:  

```python
tripleUp = 5
tripleUp *= 3
print(tripleUp) 

quarterValue = 100
quarterValue /= 4
print(quarterValue)
```

The last thing we'll look at is how to sum up three any integers that you input using incrementation. Try this it out in your notebook: 

```python
# It's important to start with defining your sum as 0 to start with. 
sum = 0

num = int(input())
sum += num

num = int(input())
sum += num

num = int(input())
sum += num

print(sum)

```

Obviously, it's redundant to keep writing out input() and sum += num so many times. In later sections, we'll learn about _loops_ which repeat a process as many times you want.
