The next _control structure_ we will learn about is the **while loop**. Sometimes, we need to repeat some action until it's successful. This is where _the while loop_ comes to the scene.


## While Loops

In _a while loop_, the boolean expression is evaluated first and if it returns `true`, then the statements inside _the while loop_ are executed. When the expression returns `false`, the control comes out of the loop and jumps to the next statement after _the while loop_.


> #### Instruction
> Follow this [**tutorial**](https://realpython.com/python-while-loop/) and play around with the commands in your own notebook.



#### Exercise
You've come across _incrementation_ twice now. It's important that we re-write the last bit of code that was in the Numbers reading section. Rather than writing num = int(input()) and sum += num three times, which is quite redundant, use a while loop that has the user input a number three times and outputs the final sum.
