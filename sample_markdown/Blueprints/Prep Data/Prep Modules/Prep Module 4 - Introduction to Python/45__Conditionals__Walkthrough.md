In this tutorial we will get to know our first Python **control structure**: the **if** statement.


## Conditionals

We've already written some Python code by this point. The code we have written so far had sequential execution. That means that lines of code are executed one after another, in an exactly specified order.

However, the real life is often more complicated. Many times, we need to skip over some lines, execute a series of statements more than once, or choose between alternate sets of statements.

That is where _control structures_ come in. _A control structure_ directs the order of the execution of a statements in a program (referred to as the programâ€™s **control flow**).

> #### Instruction
> Follow this [**tutorial**](https://realpython.com/python-conditional-statements/) and type the commands along into you own notebook. Try playing around with them a bit.
