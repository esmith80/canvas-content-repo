Let's practice working with the _basic data types_. We will cover Strings, Numbers, Lists, Tuples, and Dicts. These are very important for everything else we will be doing in Python.


## Basic Data Types Exercise


> #### Instruction 
> Download the Jupyter notebook from [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CV-IK5Z3xM3BsiTpSuDa7M8Fi0aty0hZ/view?usp=sharing) and follow the instructions.


This is a good time to zoom out for a minute and digest everything we've learned so far: 
- Basic numerics, strings, and complex types that are built into Python.
- What objects of each type look like and how we can represent them.
- We came across several of pythonâ€™s built-in functions (type, len, ...), which are pre-written chunks of code that we can call to do useful things.

With these skills, it's now time to see how computer programs make decisions based on different scenarios, and this bring us to the next section on _Conditionals_.
