It's time to take what you know about functions and gamble with it a bit. 

## Setup

> #### Instruction
> Create a `dice-roller.js` file inside of your `focal` folder.

```terminal
cd /vagrant/focal
```

```terminal
touch dice-roller.js
```

> #### Instruction
> Open the `focal` folder in VSCode and then open the new, empty file.

If the folder is not already open in your VSCode, open `focal` now.

## Challenge

> #### Instruction
> Write a program that takes a single parameter from the command line, a number, and rolls that many six-sided dice. 

For example, the following is a sample output of the program.

```terminal
> node dice-roller.js 3
Rolled 3 dice: 2, 6, 5
```

> #### Information
> To generate a random number, you'll have to use the built-in [Math.random](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random).

### Tips

> #### Information
> Always feel free to use any existing helper methods that have not been specifically prohibited.

* In an earlier exercise, we had you create your own `joinList` function to achieve a similar goal. However, for this exercise you are free to use [Array.prototype.join](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join). 


> #### Instruction
> When you've finished, don't forgot to save your work as a gist and to submit it.
