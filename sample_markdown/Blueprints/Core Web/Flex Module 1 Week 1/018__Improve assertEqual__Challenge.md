Having learned about Template Literals (Template Strings), we can improve our `assertEqual` function to use them. 

## Challenge

> #### Instruction
> Update our Lotide `assertEqual` function to use template literals when generating the output string.

This challenge assumes that you used `+` to concatenate values together for `console.log`. If you already used template literals to generate the assertion message, your work is already done!
