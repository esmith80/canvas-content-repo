Quizzes will be found frequently throughout the program and will be starting up this week! They should only take about 10-20 minutes to complete.

Please also remember that quizzes are meant to be taken individually, **not paired** and **without assistance from resources** and **notes**. Only then can they be considered fair and accurate assessments of your understanding.
