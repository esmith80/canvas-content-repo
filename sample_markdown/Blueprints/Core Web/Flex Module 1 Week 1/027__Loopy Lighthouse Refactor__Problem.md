In this activity we're going to complete the stretch exercise for Loopy Lighthouse (don't worry, this is the last time we'll be working on the activity) then refactor the solution.

## Reading

### The DRY principle

Programmers love acronyms. Some – ARGV, HTML, MDN – you've already encountered, and many more await you in this program. But one that's good to get familiar with right away is DRY – **Don't Repeat Yourself**. You'll often hear it in phrases like "keep your code dry" or "dry up your code".

The DRY principle, coined by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in *The Pragmatic Programmer*, has become one of the most fundamental to writing good code. The principle states that any piece of knowledge or functionality in a software system should be represented in a single place only – essentially, nothing should be repeated. In practice, drying up code ranges from trivial to very difficult. As you'll see throughout the bootcamp, many of the tools and coding practices we'll be learning exist to fulfill this simple-sounding principle. In the following refactoring problem, we'll take our first step in this long journey.

## Problem

If you haven't already, complete the stretch exercise in the [Loopy Lighthouse](/58451af3-8813-4f58-8407-c9b2cf0a9411) activity. Once you're done, sit with a fellow student who has also finished the stretch exercise and refactor the code together.

Figure out how to reduce repetitive code and how to make your solution as general as possible. Ask a mentor to help you with this!
