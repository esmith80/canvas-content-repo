Today we start you off on your very first project at Lighthouse Labs. You'll create a JavaScript library called [Lotide](/projects/lotide)!

## What is a Library?

Software developers realized something quite early on: the more complex our applications get, the more code we have to write to solve our problems. While that's expected, we can also end up writing the same code over and over again to solve common problems that appear in multiple applications. So instead of writing more code and repeating ourselves, developers like to import code into their projects. This is where "libraries" come in.

We'll hear the term _"library"_ quite often in the world of software development. So _what is it?_

> #### Information
> A "library" is a collection of pre-written code. Libraries can be private, but many are packaged up nicely, branded and made publicly available for other developers to use in their own projects.

_jQuery_ and _Bootstrap_ are a couple examples of publicly available libraries used by many web developers. You _may_ have heard of these, but don't worry if you haven't.

## The Lodash Library

The library we'll be focused on for our project is called [Lodash](https://lodash.com/). Think of it like a swiss army knife for JavaScript code.

> "Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc." - <small>Lodash Readme</small>

By examining [Lodash's GitHub page](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) we can see that it has quite a few stars (over 37,600 at the time of writing this). Stars on GitHub are equivalent to likes on other social networks.

This tells us that quite a few developers either use or have expressed interest in using this library. Neat!

<!-- 
But how often is it downloaded?

We can look at a JS library's download (and other) stats on its [npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash). We'll cover npm in more detail later. Don't worry about what it is for now.

This library is so popular, it's downloaded tens of millions of times per _week_. That is a lot!

## Lotide: Our Clone of Lodash

Our clone of Lodash will be called _Lotide_, an appropriately named project to work on as a student at Lighthouse Labs, don't you think? ;)

As we build smaller functions to exercise your programming chops throughout these first four weeks, we'll be essentially building our own smaller and simpler version of this awesome library. 

However, Lotide won't be our sole focus for this learning module. We will weave in and out between this project and other unrelated assignments.

_Let's get started!_
