Debugging is really an important aspect of web development. To debug more efficiently, we need to better understand error messages. By practicing reading error messages and fixing bugs accordingly, we're going to get better at understanding error messages.

## Two Debugging Challenges

> #### Instruction
> Fork and clone [this gist](https://gist.github.com/kvirani/5ae6f3171b87acfb452bcf23e6f2dc41) into our `/vagrant/focal` directory.

Remember to give the optional parameter to the `git clone` command so that it renames the directory to something memorable.

Execute the files one at a time. One defines a simple average function, the other a string reverse function - but neither work as expected due to code errors.

> #### Instruction
> Fix all the errors in both files (each file may have more than one error), without changing the implementations.

### Tips

* Make sure you understand what the code is trying to accomplish, then tackle each error one at a time. 
* Execute the code after each change you make, until you've fixed all the errors and the output is correct.

## Complete Assignment

> #### Instruction
> Commit and push your updates to GitHub.

Submit the fixed code by pasting your forked gist's URL in the Github URL field when marking this as complete.
