Mastering your text editor and Operating System (OS) will make you a more efficient and impressive developer.

Take control of your development environment by using more of the keyboard and less of the mouse/trackpad. As you write your code, use (Mac and VSCode) keyboard commands/shortcuts to work more effectively.

## Power User Commands

> #### Warning
> Don't _just_ read about these, take some time now to practice them! 

If any of these are unfamiliar to you, be sure to practice them and make a mental note to use them when possible.

As the course progresses, you will be _expected_ by teachers to use your editor/OS the way a seasoned developer does.

> #### Warning
> _Note to PC Users:_ While these are OSX-specific, the PC commands are essentially the same. Instead of <kbd>Cmd</kbd>, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> instead. This is why you'll see something like <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> which indicates to type <kbd>Cmd</kbd> on Mac and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> on PC.

### <kbd>Cmd + Tab</kbd> (OS X) / <kbd>Alt + Tab</kbd> (Win/Ubuntu)

* Used to switch between apps
* This is preferred over mac gestures to switch between apps/spaces
* Hold down <kbd>Cmd/Alt</kbd> and press Tab multiple times to select the right app
* Don't hold down <kbd>Cmd/Alt</kbd> for long (just until you hit Tab) to do a quick toggle of the last app you were on

### <kbd>Cmd + ~</kbd> (OS X)

* The tilde key is beside the 1 key on your keyboard
* Used to switch between windows of the same app
* Great for when you have multiple Chrome windows. When you use Chrome, use it to switch between all Chrome windows

### Never minimize (Any OS)

There's no need for minimizing windows once you get the hang of toggling windows with your keyboard. If you're in the habit of minimizing, we strongly recommend that you work towards the better approach of switching between windows using the keyboard shortcut shown above.

### <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F</kbd> (VSCode)

* To find (search) in all files in the open project
* _Very important and powerful_; Used commonly in projects where # of files is high (ie: most projects)
* Can use regular expressions instead of plain string
* The results are shown in a separate tab and you can interact with them (double click a result to jump to it)

### <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + Left/Right</kbd> (OS X)

> #### Information
> Try this out in VSCode on some of your code!

* Jump to start / end of line (Home / End in Win/Ubuntu)
* Used very commonly, in most editors / word processors
* Additionally hold down shift to select as you do this

### <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + T</kbd> (Terminal, Chrome, Finder)

* Create new tab (tabs are awesome!)
* Ctrl + T in Win/Ubuntu to open a new tab in Chrome

### <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + T</kbd> (Chrome)

* Re-open a previously closed tab

### <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + W</kbd> (VSCode, Chrome)

* Close the currently open tab

### <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + P</kbd> (VSCode)

* To navigate to a file (very flexible input)
* One of the _most used_ shortcuts in VSCode
* Useful for when there are many files in the project (like Lotide!) so you should start using it now

### <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + Left/Right</kbd> (VSCode, Chrome, and Terminal)

* Switch between open tabs using the left/right arrow keys
* A must use, as well. Give'r a shot!
* Can also use Cmd + Shift + [ or Cmd + Shift + ] to go left/right in tabs

### <kbd>Cmd + /</kbd> (VSCode)

* Comment out the selected line(s)
