Before beginning your lotide project, let's create a directory for the project. 

> #### Instruction
> Create a `lotide` directory in Vagrant.

```terminal
cd /vagrant
```

```terminal
mkdir lotide
```

> #### Instruction
> Inside that folder, create a new git repository.

```shell
cd lotide
git init
```

> #### Instruction
> Create a new empty repository on Github called `lotide` and add the remote, using:

```shell
git remote add origin <URL>
```

Now you can start writing files and commiting and pushing them to your repo.
