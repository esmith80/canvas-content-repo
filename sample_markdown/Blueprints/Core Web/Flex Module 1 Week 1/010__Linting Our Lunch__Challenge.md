Let's start linting with the [lunch.js solution](/d5c153ed-ef80-4ad8-a0f5-5b84d1399ca5) that we just wrote, and make sure that its code style matches our standards at Lighthouse Labs.

## Challenge

> #### Instruction
> Run ESLint against our lunch.js file.

```sh
cd /vagrant/focal/lunch
```

```sh
eslint .
```

> #### Instruction
> Fix ALL errors and warnings (if any) reported by our linter.
