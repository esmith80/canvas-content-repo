In this activity we're going to practice more debugging skills by fixing an incorrect program.

## Setup

> #### Instruction
> Fork and clone [this gist](https://gist.github.com/kvirani/bbe310c765a6a82cf751ce3e5c917b5c) into our `focal` directory. 

## Challenge

The code in this file defines a function `printInFrame` that prints a string in a "frame". It also defines a few other (helper) functions and some driver code to test the code. 

### Expected Output

Printing the strings correctly in frames would look like the following.

```terminal
node print-in-frame.js
*********
* May   *
* the   *
* force *
* be    *
* with  *
* you   *
*********
***********
* Here's  *
* Johnny! *
***********

**************************************
*********
* Lost, *
* like  *
* tears *
* in    *
* the   *
* rain  *
*********
```

Executing the code you've cloned, you'll notice it _does not_ produce the correct output. 

> #### Instruction
> Debug the code and fix any mistakes you find such that the program works correctly.

## Complete Assignment

> #### Instruction 
> Commit and push the updated file within your gist.

Make sure you commit and push your changes to your forked gist, verify that it's up there on GitHub and then submit the URL to it.
