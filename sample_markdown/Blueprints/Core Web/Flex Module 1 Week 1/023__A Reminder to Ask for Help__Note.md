If you are stuck for 15 minutes or more, it's time to hit the Request Assistance button. If you know that you're the type of person who likes to figure things out on your own, just remember: mentors are here to help you on what you don't understand, but they are also here to teach you how to approach problems and how to think as a developer - things that you will sorely miss out on if you aren't asking for help.
