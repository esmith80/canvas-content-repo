As mentioned before, we suggest spending a majority of your remaining time today on programming katas. These are a great way to keep our programming skills sharp!

> #### Instruction
> Pick a core or stretch [kata from the prep course](/e344a63a-c498-4271-a739-c1239637d545) which you did not complete (or completed but with help from others / the help forum) and spend time trying to solve it independently.

We suggest starting the problem from scratch, without referencing prior work or partial solutions.

If you finish the first kata you pick with enough time and energy left, feel free to grab more from your incomplete list!

> #### Warning
> Don't forget to run `eslint` against your solution.

The programming tests also deduct points for code style, based on lint errors & warnings.
